  # policy.csv holds the CSV file policy file which contains additional policy and role definitions.
  # ArgoCD defines two built-in roles:
  # * role:readonly - readonly access to all objects
  # * role:admin - admin access to all objects
  # The built-in policy can be seen under util/rbac/builtin-policy.csv
  #
  # The policy definition format is:
  # p, <user/group>, <resource>, <action>, <project>/<object>
  # For example, the following rule gives all members of 'my-org:team1' the ability to sync
  # applications in the project named: my-project
  # p, my-org:team1, applications, sync, my-project/*
  #
  # The role definition format is:
  # g, <user/group>, <group>
  # For example, the following rule makes all members of 'my-org:team2' have the role:admin role:
  # g, my-org:team2, role:admin
  policy.csv: ""

  # policy.default holds the default policy which will ArgoCD will fall back to, when authorizing
  # a user for API requests.
