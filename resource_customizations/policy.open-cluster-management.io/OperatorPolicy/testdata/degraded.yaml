        NonCompliant; the policy spec is valid, the policy does not specify an
        OperatorGroup but one already exists in the namespace - assuming that
        OperatorGroup is correct, the Subscription required by the policy was
        not found, there are no relevant InstallPlans in the namespace, the
        ClusterServiceVersion required by the policy was not found, no CRDs were
        found for the operator, there are no relevant deployments because the 
        ClusterServiceVersion is missing, CatalogSource was found
