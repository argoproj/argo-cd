          Code is only run client-side in the swagger-ui endpoint. No risk of

        reason: >-
          Argo CD uses go-restful as a transitive dependency of kube-openapi. kube-openapi is used to generate openapi
          specs. We do not use go-restul at runtime and are therefore not vulnerable to this CORS misconfiguration
          issue in go-restful.

    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Code is only run client-side. No risk of arbitrary file upload.

    - '*':
        reason: >-
          The package is used to parse configuration provided by the administrator and hence cannot cause DoS.
