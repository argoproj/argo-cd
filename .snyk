          Code is only run client-side in the swagger-ui endpoint. No risk of
          server-side DoS.

  SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMEMICKLEIGORESTFUL-2435653:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Argo CD uses go-restful as a transitive dependency of kube-openapi. kube-openapi is used to generate openapi
          specs. We do not use go-restul at runtime and are therefore not vulnerable to this CORS misconfiguration
          issue in go-restful.
  SNYK-JS-FORMIDABLE-2838956:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Code is only run client-side. No risk of arbitrary file upload.
  SNYK-JS-PARSEPATH-2936439:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          The issue is that, for specific URLs, parse-path may incorrectly identify the "resource" (domain name)
          portion. For example, in "http://127.0.0.1#@example.com", it identifies "example.com" as the "resource".

          We use parse-path on the client side, but permissions for git URLs are checked server-side. This is a
          potential usability issue, but it is not a security issue.
