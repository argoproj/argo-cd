  ### Default configuration for exclusions.
  # The exclusion list are K8s resources that we assume will never be declared in Git,
  # and are never child objects of managed resources that need to be presented in the resource tree.
  # This list contains high volume and  high churn metadata objects which we exclude for performance
  # reasons, reducing connections and load to the K8s API servers of managed clusters.
