                                    as for rollbacks to previous versions. This should
                                    only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will
                                    reduce storage used. Increasing will increase
                                    the space used to store the history, so we do
                                    not recommend increasing it. Default is 10.

                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will
                                    reduce storage used. Increasing will increase

                                    not recommend increasing it. Default is 10.

                                    reduce storage used. Increasing will increase

                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will
                                    reduce storage used. Increasing will increase

                                    not recommend increasing it. Default is 10.
