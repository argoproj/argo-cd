                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                    RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                    This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
                                    Default is 10.

                                    This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
                                    Default is 10.

                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.

                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.

                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
                                              Default is 10.

                                              RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions.
                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                              This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                              Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                              Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                    This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                        TargetRevision defines the revision of the source to sync the application to.
                                        In case of Git, this can be commit, tag, or branch. If omitted, will equal to HEAD.
                                        In case of Helm, this is a semver tag for the Chart's version.

                                    This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                    This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances.
                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.

                                    Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used.
                                    Increasing will increase the space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
