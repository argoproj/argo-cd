Why Argo CD? \u00b6 Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand. Getting Started \u00b6 Quick Start \u00b6 kubectl create namespace argocd kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml Follow our getting started guide . Further user oriented documentation is provided for additional features. If you are looking to upgrade ArgoCD, see the upgrade guide . Developer oriented documentation is available for people interested in building third-party integrations. How it works \u00b6 Argo CD follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. Kubernetes manifests can be specified in several ways: kustomize applications helm charts ksonnet applications jsonnet files Plain directory of YAML/json manifests Any custom config management tool configured as a config management plugin Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit. See tracking strategies for additional details about the different tracking strategies available. For a quick 10 minute overview of Argo CD, check out the demo presented to the Sig Apps community meeting: Architecture \u00b6 Argo CD is implemented as a kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares the current, live state against the desired target state (as specified in the Git repo). A deployed application whose live state deviates from the target state is considered OutOfSync . Argo CD reports & visualizes the differences, while providing facilities to automatically or manually sync the live state back to the desired target state. Any modifications made to the desired target state in the Git repo can be automatically applied and reflected in the specified target environments. For additional details, see architecture overview . Features \u00b6 Automated deployment of applications to specified target environments Support for multiple config management/templating tools (Kustomize, Helm, Ksonnet, Jsonnet, plain-YAML) Ability to manage and deploy to multiple clusters SSO Integration (OIDC, OAuth2, LDAP, SAML 2.0, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, LinkedIn) Multi-tenancy and RBAC policies for authorization Rollback/Roll-anywhere to any application configuration committed in Git repository Health status analysis of application resources Automated configuration drift detection and visualization Automated or manual syncing of applications to its desired state Web UI which provides real-time view of application activity CLI for automation and CI integration Webhook integration (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) Access tokens for automation PreSync, Sync, PostSync hooks to support complex application rollouts (e.g.blue/green & canary upgrades) Audit trails for application events and API calls Prometheus metrics Parameter overrides for overriding ksonnet/helm parameters in Git Development Status \u00b6 Argo CD is being actively developed by the community.

Many of them not bugs, but questions, or very environment related. It's easy to lose oversight. Also, it's not obvious which bugs are important. Which bugs should be fixed first? Can we make a new release with the current inventory of open bugs? Is there still a bug that should make it to the new release? Proposal \u00b6 We should agree upon a common issue triage process. The process must be lean and efficient, and should support us and the community looking into the GH issue tracker at making the following decisions: Is it even a real bug? If it is a real bug, what is the current status of the bug (next to \"open\" or \"closed\")? How important is it to fix the bug? How urgent is it to fix the bug? Who will be working to fix the bug? We need new methods to classify our bugs, at least into these categories: validity: Does the issue indeed represent a true bug severity: Denominates what impact the bug has priority: Denominates the urgency of the fix Triage process \u00b6 GH issue tracker provides us with the possibility to label issues. Using these labels is not perfect, but should give a good start. Each new issue created in our issue tracker should be correctly labeled during its lifecycle, so keeping an overview would be simplified by the ability to filter for labels. The triage process could be as follows: A new bug issue is created by someone on the tracker The first person of the core team to see it will start the triage by classifying the issue (see below). This will indicate the creator that we have noticed the issue, and that it's not \"fire & forget\" tracker. Initial classification should be possible even when much of the information is missing yet. In this case, the issue would be classified as such (see below). Again, this indicates that someone has noticed the issue, and there is activity in progress to get the required information. Classification of the issue can change over its life-cycle. However, once the issue has been initially classified correctly (that is, with something else than the \"placeholder\" classification discussed above), changes to the classification should be discussed first with the person who initially classified the issue. Classification \u00b6 We have introduced some new labels in the GH issue tracker for classifying the bug issues. These labels are prefixed with the string bug/ , and should be applied to all new issues in our tracker. Classification requires more information \u00b6 If it is not yet possible to classify the bug, i.e. because more information is required to correctly classify the bug, you should always set the label bug/in-triage to make it clear that triage process has started but could not yet be completed. Issue type \u00b6 If it's clear that a bug issue is not a bug, but a question or reach for support, it should be marked as such: Remove any of the labels prefixed bug/ that might be attached to the issue Remove the label bug from the issue Add the label inquiry to the issue If the inquiry turns out to be something that should be covered by the docs, but is not, the following actions should be taken: The title of the issue should be adapted that it will be clear that the bug affects the docs, not the code The label documentation should be attached to the issue If the issue is too confusing (can happen), another possibility is to close the issue and create a new one as described in above (with a meaningful title and the label documentation attached to it). Validity \u00b6 Some reported bugs may be invalid. It could be a user error, a misconfiguration or something along these lines. If it is clear that the bug falls into one of these categories: Remove any of the labels prefixed bug/ that might be attached to the issue Add the label invalid to the issue Retain the bug label to the issue Close the issue When closing the issue, it is important to let requester know why the issue has been closed. The optimum would be to provide a solution to his request in the comments of the issue, or at least pointers to possible solutions. Regressions \u00b6 Sometimes it happens that something that worked in a previous release does not work now when it should still work. If this is the case, the following actions should be done Add the label regression to the issue Continue with triage Severity \u00b6 It is important to find out how severe the impact of a bug is, and to label the bug with this information. For this purpose, the following labels exist in our tracker: bug/severity:minor : Bug has limited impact and maybe affects only an edge-case. Core functionality is not affected, and there is no data loss involved. Something might not work as expected. Example of these kind of bugs could be a CLI command that is not working as expected, a glitch in the UI, wrong documentation, etc. bug/severity:major : Malfunction in one of the core components, impacting a majority of users or one of the core functionalities in ArgoCD. There is no data loss involved, but for example a sync is not working due to a bug in ArgoCD (and not due to user error), manifests fail to render, etc. bug/severity:critical : A critical bug in ArgoCD, possibly resulting in data loss, integrity breach or severe degraded overall functionality. Priority \u00b6 The priority of an issue indicates how quickly the issue should be fixed and released. This information should help us in deciding the target release for the fix, and whether a bug would even justify a dedicated patch release. The following labels can be used to classify bugs into their priority: bug/priority:low : Will be fixed without any specific target release. bug/priority:medium : Should be fixed in the minor or major release, which ever comes first. bug/priority:high : Should be fixed with the next patch release. bug/priority:urgent : Should be fixed immediately and might even justify a dedicated patch release. The priority should be set according to the value of the fix and the attached severity. This means. a bug with a severity of minor could still be classified with priority high , when it is a low hanging fruit (i.e. the bug is easy to fix with low effort) and contributes to overall user experience of ArgoCD. Likewise, a bug classified with a severity of major could still have a priority of medium , if there is a workaround available for the bug which mitigates the effects of the bug to a bearable extend. Bugs classified with a severity of critical most likely belong to either the urgent priority, or to the high category when there is a workaround available. Bugs that have a regression label attached (see Regression above) should usually be handled with higher priority, so those kind of issues will most likely have a priority of high or urgent attached to it. Summary \u00b6 Applying a little discipline when working with our issue tracker could greatly help us in making informed decision about which bugs to fix when. Also, it would help us to get a clear view whether we can do for example a new minor release without having forgot any outstanding issues that should make it into that release. If we are able to work with classification of bug issues, we might want to extend the triage for enhancement proposals and PRs as well.","title":"Bug triage proposal for ArgoCD"},{"location":"bug_triage/#bug-triage-proposal-for-argocd","text":"","title":"Bug triage proposal for ArgoCD"},{"location":"bug_triage/#situation","text":"Lots of issues on our issue tracker.

You need to either: Reinstate/fix your repo. Delete the app using --cascade=false and then manually deleting the resources. Why is my application still OutOfSync immediately after a successful Sync? \u00b6 See Diffing documentation for reasons resources can be OutOfSync, and ways to configure Argo CD to ignore fields when differences are expected. Why is my application stuck in Progressing state? \u00b6 Argo CD provides health for several standard Kubernetes types. The Ingress and StatefulSet types have known issues which might cause health check to return Progressing state instead of Healthy . Ingress is considered healthy if status.loadBalancer.ingress list is non-empty, with at least one value for hostname or IP . Some ingress controllers ( contour , traefik ) don't update status.loadBalancer.ingress field which causes Ingress to stuck in Progressing state forever. StatefulSet is considered healthy if value of status.updatedReplicas field matches to spec.replicas field. Due to Kubernetes bug kubernetes/kubernetes#68573 the status.updatedReplicas is not populated. So unless you run Kubernetes version which include the fix kubernetes/kubernetes#67570 StatefulSet might stay in Progressing state. Your StatefulSet or DaemonSet is using OnDelete instead of RollingUpdate strategy. See #1881 . As workaround Argo CD allows providing health check customization which overrides default behavior. I forgot the admin password, how do I reset it? \u00b6 By default the password is set to the name of the server pod, as per the getting started guide . To change the password, edit the argocd-secret secret and update the admin.password field with a new bcrypt hash. You can use a site like https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt to generate a new hash. For example: # bcrypt(password)=$2a$10$rRyBsGSHK6.uc8fntPwVIuLVHgsAhAX7TcdrqW/RADU0uh7CaChLa kubectl -n argocd patch secret argocd-secret \\ -p '{\"stringData\": { \"admin.password\": \"$2a$10$rRyBsGSHK6.uc8fntPwVIuLVHgsAhAX7TcdrqW/RADU0uh7CaChLa\", \"admin.passwordMtime\": \"' $( date +%FT%T%Z ) '\" }}' Another option is to delete both the admin.password and admin.passwordMtime keys and restart argocd-server. This will set the password back to the pod name as per the getting started guide . How to disable admin user? \u00b6 Add admin.enabled: \"false\" to the argocd-cm ConfigMap (see user management ). Argo CD cannot deploy Helm Chart based applications without internet access, how can I solve it? \u00b6 Argo CD might fail to generate Helm chart manifests if the chart has dependencies located in external repositories. To solve the problem you need to make sure that requirements.yaml uses only internally available Helm repositories. Even if the chart uses only dependencies from internal repos Helm might decide to refresh stable repo. As workaround override stable repo URL in argocd-cm config map: data : # v1.2 or earlier use `helm.repositories` helm.repositories : | - url: http://<internal-helm-repo-host>:8080 name: stable # v1.3 or later use `repositories` with `type: helm` repositories : | - type: helm url: http://<internal-helm-repo-host>:8080 name: stable I've configured cluster secret but it does not show up in CLI/UI, how do I fix it? \u00b6 Check if cluster secret has argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster label. If secret has the label but the cluster is still not visible then make sure it might be a permission issue. Try to list clusters using admin user (e.g. argocd login --username admin && argocd cluster list ). Argo CD is unable to connect to my cluster, how do I troubleshoot it? \u00b6 Use the following steps to reconstruct configured cluster config and connect to your cluster manually using kubectl: kubectl exec -it <argocd-pod-name> bash # ssh into any argocd server pod argocd-util kubeconfig https://<cluster-url> /tmp/config --namespace argocd # generate your cluster config KUBECONFIG = /tmp/config kubectl get pods # test connection manually Now you can manually verify that cluster is accessible from the Argo CD pod. How Can I Terminate A Sync? \u00b6 To terminate the sync, click on the \"synchronisation\" then \"terminate\": Why Is My App Out Of Sync Even After Syncing? \u00b6 Is some cases, the tool you use may conflict with Argo CD by adding the app.kubernetes.io/instance label. E.g. using Kustomize common labels feature. Argo CD automatically sets the app.kubernetes.io/instance label and uses it to determine which resources form the app. If the tool does this too, this causes confusion. You can change this label by setting the application.instanceLabelKey value in the argocd-cm . We recommend that you use argocd.argoproj.io/instance . Note When you make this change your applications will become out of sync and will need re-syncing. See #1482 . Why Are My Resource Limits Out Of Sync? \u00b6 Kubernetes has normalized your resource limits when they are applied, and then Argo CD has then compared the version in your generated manifests to the normalized one is Kubernetes - they won't match. E.g. '1000m' normalized to '1' '0.1' normalized to '100m' '3072Mi' normalized to '3Gi' 3072 normalized to '3072' (quotes added) To fix this use diffing customizations settings . How Do I Fix \"invalid cookie, longer than max length 4093\"? \u00b6 Argo CD uses a JWT as the auth token. You likely are part of many groups and have gone over the 4KB limit which is set for cookies. You can get the list of groups by opening \"developer tools -> network\" Click log in Find the call to <argocd_instance>/auth/callback?code=<random_string> Decode the token at https://jwt.io/.

Some ingress controllers ( contour , traefik ) don't update status.loadBalancer.ingress field which causes Ingress to stuck in Progressing state forever. StatefulSet is considered healthy if value of status.updatedReplicas field matches to spec.replicas field.

Please read understanding the basics to learn about these tools. Requirements \u00b6 Installed kubectl command-line tool Have a kubeconfig file (default location is ~/.kube/config ). 1. Install Argo CD \u00b6 kubectl create namespace argocd kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml This will create a new namespace, argocd , where Argo CD services and application resources will live. Note If you are not interested in UI, SSO, multi-cluster management and just want to pull changes into the cluster then you can disable authentication using --disable-auth flag and access Argo CD via CLI using --port-forward or --port-forward-namespace flags and proceed to step #6 : kubectl patch deploy argocd-server -n argocd -p '[{\"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/command/-\", \"value\": \"--disable-auth\"}]' --type json 2. Download Argo CD CLI \u00b6 Download the latest Argo CD version from https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest . More detailed installation instructions can be found via the CLI installation documentation . Also available in Mac Homebrew: brew install argocd 3. Access The Argo CD API Server \u00b6 By default, the Argo CD API server is not exposed with an external IP. To access the API server, choose one of the following techniques to expose the Argo CD API server: Service Type Load Balancer \u00b6 Change the argocd-server service type to LoadBalancer : kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{\"spec\": {\"type\": \"LoadBalancer\"}}' Ingress \u00b6 Follow the ingress documentation on how to configure Argo CD with ingress. Port Forwarding \u00b6 Kubectl port-forwarding can also be used to connect to the API server without exposing the service. kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080 :443 The API server can then be accessed using the localhost:8080 4. Login Using The CLI \u00b6 The initial password is autogenerated to be the pod name of the Argo CD API server. This can be retrieved with the command: kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name = argocd-server -o name | cut -d '/' -f 2 Using the username admin and the password from above, login to Argo CD's IP or hostname: argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER> Change the password using the command: argocd account update-password Note The initial password is set in a kubernetes secret, named argocd-secret , during ArgoCD's initial start up. This means if you edit the deployment in any way which causes a new pod to be deployed, such as disabling TLS on the Argo CD API server. Take note of the initial pod name when you first install Argo CD, or reset the password by following these instructions 5. Register A Cluster To Deploy Apps To (Optional) \u00b6 This step registers a cluster's credentials to Argo CD, and is only necessary when deploying to an external cluster. When deploying internally (to the same cluster that Argo CD is running in), https://kubernetes.default.svc should be used as the application's K8s API server address. First list all clusters contexts in your current kubeconfig: kubectl config get-contexts -o name Choose a context name from the list and supply it to argocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME . For example, for docker-desktop context, run: argocd cluster add docker-desktop The above command installs a ServiceAccount ( argocd-manager ), into the kube-system namespace of that kubectl context, and binds the service account to an admin-level ClusterRole. Argo CD uses this service account token to perform its management tasks (i.e. deploy/monitoring). Note The rules of the argocd-manager-role role can be modified such that it only has create , update , patch , delete privileges to a limited set of namespaces, groups, kinds. However get , list , watch privileges are required at the cluster-scope for Argo CD to function. 6. Create An Application From A Git Repository \u00b6 An example repository containing a guestbook application is available at https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git to demonstrate how Argo CD works. Creating Apps Via CLI \u00b6 Note You can access Argo CD using port forwarding: add --port-forward-namespace argocd flag to every CLI command or set ARGOCD_OPTS environment variable: export ARGOCD_OPTS='--port-forward-namespace argocd' : argocd app create guestbook --repo https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git --path guestbook --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default Creating Apps Via UI \u00b6 Open a browser to the Argo CD external UI, and login by visiting the IP/hostname in a browser and use the credentials set in step 4. After logging in, click the + New App button as shown below: Give your app the name guestbook , use the project default , and leave the sync policy as Manual : Connect the https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git repo to Argo CD by setting repository url to the github repo url, leave revision as HEAD , and set the path to guestbook : For Destination , set cluster to in-cluster and namespace to default : After filling out the information above, click Create at the top of the UI to create the guestbook application: 7. Sync (Deploy) The Application \u00b6 From CLI: \u00b6 Once the guestbook application is created, you can now view its status: $ argocd app get guestbook Name: guestbook Server: https://kubernetes.default.svc Namespace: default URL: https://10.97.164.88/applications/guestbook Repo: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git Target: Path: guestbook Sync Policy: <none> Sync Status: OutOfSync from ( 1ff8a67 ) Health Status: Missing GROUP KIND NAMESPACE NAME STATUS HEALTH apps Deployment default guestbook-ui OutOfSync Missing Service default guestbook-ui OutOfSync Missing The application status is initially in OutOfSync state since the application has yet to be deployed, and no Kubernetes resources have been created.

The user interface becomes notably slower if one Argo CD instance manages more than 1 thousand applications. A set of optimizations is required to fix that issue. 100+ Clusters support. The cluster addon management use-case requires connecting a large number of clusters to one Argo CD controller. Currently Argo CD controller is unable to handle that many clusters. The solution is to support horizontal controller scaling and automated sharding. Mono Repository support. Argo CD is not optimized for mono repositories with a large number of applications. With 50+ applications in the same repository, manifest generation performance drops significantly. The repository server optimization is required to improve it. ApplicationsSet \u00b6 Argo CD Applications allow splitting the cluster configuration into logic groups that are managed independently. However, the set of applications is a configuration that should be managed declaratively as well. The app-of-apps pattern solves this problem but still has some challenges such as maintenance overhead, security, and lack of some additional features. ApplicationsSet project provides a better solution for managing applications across multiple environments. Large Applications support \u00b6 The application details page is not suitable to visualize applications that include a large number of resources (hundreds of resources). The page has to be reworked to improve user experience. Serviceability \u00b6 To make Argo CD successful we need to build tools that enable Argo CD administrators to handle scalability and performance issues in a self-service model. That includes more metrics, out of the box alerts and a cluster management user interface. GitOps Engine Enhancements \u00b6 The GitOps Engine is a library that implements core GitOps functions such as K8S resource reconciliation and diffing. A lot of Argo CD features are still not available in GitOps engine. The following features have to be contributed to the GitOps Engine: an ability to customize resources health assessment and existing CRD health assessment functions . resource diffing customization . config management tools integration unified syncing annotations argoproj/gitops-engine#43 GitOps Agent \u00b6 GitOps Agent is a continuation of GitOps engine work. The GitOps Agent leverages the GitOps Engine and provides access to many engine features via a simple CLI interface. Config Management Tools Integrations \u00b6 The community likes the first class support of Helm, Kustomize and keeps requesting support for more tools. Argo CD provides a mechanism to integrate with any config management tool. We need to investigate why it is not enough and implement missing features. Resource Actions Revamp \u00b6 Resource actions is very powerful but literally hidden feature. Documentation is missing and therefore adoption is poor. We need to document and promote it, and then iterate and work on enhancements: - hard to configure unless you are Argo CD ninja; - half done parameters support: we have backend but no UI/CLI for it; - configuration issue: it is impossible to share actions as a YAML file since ALL resource customizations are stored in one config map key; Argo CD Notifications \u00b6 Argo CD Notifications provides the ability to notify users about Argo CD Application changes as well as implement integrations such as update Github commit status, trigger Jenkins job, set Grafana label, etc. Automated Registry Monitoring \u00b6 Argo CD Image Updater provides an ability to monitor Docker registries and automatically update image versions in the deployment repository. https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/1648 Application Details Page Usability \u00b6 Application details page has accumulated multiple usability and feature requests such as Node view , Logs ( 1 , 2 ), Network view ( 1 , 2 ) etc . Cluster Management User Interface \u00b6 Argo CD has information about whole clusters, not just applications in it. We need to provide a user interface for cluster administrators that visualize cluster level resources. Projects Enhancements \u00b6 Argo CD projects accumulated a lot of debt: - Users don't know how to use project roles and SSO. It is one of the key features but not documented well. We need to document and promote it. - Project management UI has evolved organically and needs a complete redesign. We packaged everything into one sliding panel which is painful to use. - Enhancements: #2718 , #3598","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"roadmap/#roadmap","text":"Roadmap Core Functionality Bug Fixes Performance ApplicationsSet Large Applications support Serviceability GitOps Engine Enhancements GitOps Agent Config Management Tools Integrations Resource Actions Revamp Argo CD Notifications Automated Registry Monitoring Application Details Page Usability Cluster Management User Interface Projects Enhancements","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"roadmap/#core-functionality-bug-fixes","text":"The core GitOps features still have several known bugs and limitations.

The Argoproj team takes security very seriously and continuously working on improving it. Learn more about security related features in Security section. Overview of past and current issues \u00b6 The following table gives a general overview about past and present issues known to the ArgoCD project. See in the Known Issues section if there is a work-around available if you cannot update or if there is no fix yet. Date CVE Title Risk Affected version(s) Fix version 2020-06-16 CVE-2020-1747 PyYAML library susceptible to arbitrary code execution High all v1.5.8 2020-04-14 CVE-2020-5260 Possible Git credential leak High all v1.4.3,v1.5.2 2020-04-08 CVE-2020-11576 User Enumeration Medium v1.5.0 v1.5.1 2020-04-08 CVE-2020-8826 Session-fixation High all n/a 2020-04-08 CVE-2020-8827 Insufficient anti-automation/anti-brute force High all <= 1.5.3 v1.5.3 2020-04-08 CVE-2020-8828 Insecure default administrative password High all n/a 2020-04-08 CVE-2018-21034 Sensitive Information Disclosure Medium all <= v1.5.0 v1.5.0 Known Issues And Workarounds \u00b6 A recent security audit (thanks a lot to Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai ) has revealed several limitations in Argo CD which could compromise security. Most of the issues are related to the built-in user management implementation. CVE-2020-1747 - PyYAML library susceptible to arbitrary code execution \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround High infa-kparida v1.5.8 No Details: PyYAML library susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files. We do not believe ArgoCD is affected by this vulnerability, because the impact of CVE-2020-1747 is limited to usage of awscli. The awscli only used for AWS IAM authentication, and the endpoint is the AWS API. CVE-2020-5260 - Possible Git credential leak \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround Critical Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero v1.4.3,v1.5.2 Yes Details: ArgoCD relies on Git for many of its operations. The Git project released a security advisory on 2020-04-14, describing a serious vulnerability in Git which can lead to credential leakage through credential helpers by feeding malicious URLs to the git clone operation. We do not believe ArgoCD is affected by this vulnerability, because ArgoCD does neither make use of Git credential helpers nor does it use git clone for repository operations. However, we do not know whether our users might have configured Git credential helpers on their own and chose to release new images which contain the bug fix for Git. Mitigation and/or workaround: We strongly recommend to upgrade your ArgoCD installation to either v1.4.3 (if on v1.4 branch) or v1.5.2 (if on v1.5 branch) When you are running v1.4.x , you can upgrade to v1.4.3 by simply changing the image tags for argocd-server , argocd-repo-server and argocd-controller to v1.4.3 . The v1.4.3 release does not contain additional functional bug fixes. Likewise, hen you are running v1.5.x , you can upgrade to v1.5.2 by simply changing the image tags for argocd-server , argocd-repo-server and argocd-controller to v1.5.2 . The v1.5.2 release does not contain additional functional bug fixes. CVE-2020-11576 - User Enumeration \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround Medium Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai v1.5.1 Yes Details: Argo version v1.5.0 was vulnerable to a user-enumeration vulnerability which allowed attackers to determine the usernames of valid (non-SSO) accounts within Argo. Mitigation and/or workaround: Upgrade to ArgoCD v1.5.1 or higher. As a workaround, disable local users and use only SSO authentication. CVE-2020-8828 - Insecure default administrative password \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround High Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai n/a Yes Details: Argo CD uses the argocd-server pod name (ex: argocd-server-55594fbdb9-ptsf5 ) as the default admin password. Kubernetes users able to list pods in the argo namespace are able to retrieve the default password. Additionally, In most installations, the Pod name contains a random \"trail\" of characters . These characters are generated using a time-seeded PRNG and not a CSPRNG. An attacker could use this information in an attempt to deduce the state of the internal PRNG, aiding bruteforce attacks. Mitigation and/or workaround: The recommended mitigation as described in the user documentation is to use SSO integration. The default admin password should only be used for initial configuration and then disabled or at least changed to a more secure password. CVE-2020-8827 - Insufficient anti-automation/anti-brute force \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround High Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai n/a Yes Details: ArgoCD before v1.5.3 does not enforce rate-limiting or other anti-automation mechanisms which would mitigate admin password brute force. Mitigation and/or workaround: Rate-limiting and anti-automation mechanisms for local user accounts have been introduced with ArgoCD v1.5.3. As a workaround for mitigation if you cannot upgrade ArgoCD to v1.5.3 yet, we recommend to disable local users and use SSO instead. CVE-2020-8826 - Session-fixation \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround High Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai n/a Yes Details: The authentication tokens generated for built-in users have no expiry. These issues might be acceptable in the controlled isolated environment but not acceptable if Argo CD user interface is exposed to the Internet. Mitigation and/or workaround: The recommended mitigation is to change the password periodically to invalidate the authentication tokens. CVE-2018-21034 - Sensitive Information Disclosure \u00b6 Summary: Risk Reported by Fix version Workaround Medium Matt Hamilton of https://soluble.ai v1.5.0 No Details: In Argo versions prior to v1.5.0-rc1, it was possible for authenticated Argo users to submit API calls to retrieve secrets and other manifests which were stored within git. Mitigation and/or workaround: Upgrade to ArgoCD v1.5.0 or higher. No workaround available Reporting Vulnerabilities \u00b6 If you find a security related bug in ArgoCD, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze and develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability.

Can I retrigger the checks without pushing a new commit? \u00b6 Since the CI pipeline is triggered on Git commits, there is currently no (known) way on how to retrigger the CI checks without pushing a new commit to your branch. If you are absolutely sure that the failure was due to a failure in the pipeline, and not an error within the changes you commited, you can push an empty commit to your branch, thus retriggering the pipeline without any code changes. To do so, issue git commit --allow-empty -m \"Retrigger CI pipeline\" git push origin <yourbranch> Why does the build step fail? \u00b6 First, make sure the failing build step succeeds on your machine. Remember the containerized build toolchain is available, too. If the build is failing at the Ensuring Gopkg.lock is up-to-date step, you need to update the dependencies before you push your commits. Run make dep-ensure and make dep and commit the changes to Gopkg.lock to your branch. Why does the codegen step fail? \u00b6 If the codegen step fails with \"Check nothing has changed...\", chances are high that you did not run make codegen , or did not commit the changes it made. You should double check by running make codegen followed by git status in the local working copy of your branch. Commit any changes and push them to your GH branch to have the CI check it again. A second common case for this is, when you modified any of the auto generated assets, as these will be overwritten upon make codegen . Generally, this step runs codegen and compares the outcome against the Git branch it has checked out. If there are differences, the step will fail. See What checked-in code is generated and where does it come from? for more information. Why does the lint step fail? \u00b6 Your code failed to lint correctly, or modifications were performed by the golangci-lint process. You should run make lint , or golangci-lint run on your local branch and fix all the issues. If you receive an error like, File is not `goimports`-ed (goimports) , the file is not formatted correctly. Run gofmt -w $file.go to resolve this linter error.

This guide shall help you in setting up your build & test environment, so that you can start developing and testing bug fixes and feature enhancements without having to make too much effort in setting up a local toolchain. If you want to submit a PR, please read this document carefully, as it contains important information guiding you through our PR quality gates. As is the case with the development process, this document is under constant change. If you notice any error, or if you think this document is out-of-date, or if you think it is missing something: Feel free to submit a PR or submit a bug to our GitHub issue tracker. If you need guidance with submitting a PR, or have any other questions regarding development of ArgoCD, do not hesitate to join our Slack and get in touch with us in the #argo-dev channel! Before you start \u00b6 You will need at least the following things in your toolchain in order to develop and test ArgoCD locally: A Kubernetes cluster. You won't need a fully blown multi-master, multi-node cluster, but you will need something like K3S, Minikube or microk8s. You will also need a working Kubernetes client ( kubectl ) configuration in your development environment. The configuration must reside in ~/.kube/config and the API server URL must point to the IP address of your local machine (or VM), and not to localhost or 127.0.0.1 if you are using the virtualized development toolchain (see below) You will also need a working Docker runtime environment, to be able to build and run images. The Docker version must be fairly recent, and support multi-stage builds. You should not work as root. Make your local user a member of the docker group to be able to control the Docker service on your machine. Obviously, you will need a git client for pulling source code and pushing back your changes. Last but not least, you will need a Go SDK and related tools (such as GNU make ) installed and working on your development environment. The minimum required Go version for building ArgoCD is v1.14.0 . We will assume that your Go workspace is at ~/go Note Attention minikube users : By default, minikube will create Kubernetes client configuration that uses authentication data from files. This is incompatible with the virtualized toolchain. So if you intend to use the virtualized toolchain, you have to embed this authentication data into the client configuration. To do so, issue minikube config set embed-certs true and restart your minikube. Please also note that minikube using the Docker driver is currently not supported with the virtualized toolchain, because the Docker driver exposes the API server on 127.0.0.1 hard-coded. If in doubt, run make verify-kube-connect to find out. Submitting PRs \u00b6 When you submit a PR against ArgoCD's GitHub repository, a couple of CI checks will be run automatically to ensure your changes will build fine and meet certain quality standards. Your contribution needs to pass those checks in order to be merged into the repository. In general, it might be beneficial to only submit a PR for an existing issue. Especially for larger changes, an Enhancement Proposal should exist before. Note Please make sure that you always create PRs from a branch that is up-to-date with the latest changes from ArgoCD's master branch. Depending on how long it takes for the maintainers to review and merge your PR, it might be necessary to pull in latest changes into your branch again. Please understand that we, as an Open Source project, have limited capacities for reviewing and merging PRs to ArgoCD. We will do our best to review your PR and give you feedback as soon as possible, but please bear with us if it takes a little longer as expected. The following read will help you to submit a PR that meets the standards of our CI tests: Title of the PR \u00b6 Please use a meaningful and concise title for your PR. This will help us to pick PRs for review quickly, and the PR title will also end up in the Changelog. We use the Semantic PR title checker to categorize your PR into one of the following categories: fix - Your PR contains one or more code bug fixes feat - Your PR contains a new feature docs - Your PR improves the documentation chore - Your PR improves any internals of ArgoCD, such as the build process, unit tests, etc Please prefix the title of your PR with one of the valid categories. For example, if you chose the title your PR Add documentation for GitHub SSO integration , please use docs: Add documentation for GitHub SSO integration instead. Contributor License Agreement \u00b6 Every contributor to ArgoCD must have signed the current Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You only have to sign the CLA when you are a first time contributor, or when the agreement has changed since your last time signing it. The main purpose of the CLA is to ensure that you hold the required rights for your contribution. The CLA signing is an automated process. You can read the current version of the CLA here . PR template checklist \u00b6 Upon opening a PR, the details will contain a checklist from a template. Please read the checklist, and tick those marks that apply to you. Automated builds & tests \u00b6 After you have submitted your PR, and whenever you push new commits to that branch, GitHub will run a number of Continuous Integration checks against your code. It will execute the following actions, and each of them has to pass: Build the Go code ( make build ) Generate API glue code and manifests ( make codegen ) Run a Go linter on the code ( make lint ) Run the unit tests ( make test ) Run the End-to-End tests ( make test-e2e ) Build and lint the UI code ( make lint-ui ) Build the argocd CLI ( make cli ) If any of these tests in the CI pipeline fail, it means that some of your contribution is considered faulty (or a test might be flaky, see below). Code test coverage \u00b6 We use CodeCov in our CI pipeline to check for test coverage, and once you submit your PR, it will run and report on the coverage difference as a comment within your PR. If the difference is too high in the negative, i.e. your submission introduced a significant drop in code coverage, the CI check will fail. Whenever you develop a new feature or submit a bug fix, please also write appropriate unit tests for it. If you write a completely new module, please aim for at least 80% of coverage. If you want to see how much coverage just a specific module (i.e. your new one) has, you can set the TEST_MODULE to the (fully qualified) name of that module with make test , i.e. make test TEST_MODULE = github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/server/cache ... ok github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/server/cache 0 .029s coverage: 89 .3% of statements Local vs Virtualized toolchain \u00b6 ArgoCD provides a fully virtualized development and testing toolchain using Docker images. It is recommended to use those images, as they provide the same runtime environment as the final product and it is much easier to keep up-to-date with changes to the toolchain and dependencies. But as using Docker comes with a slight performance penalty, you might want to setup a local toolchain. Most relevant targets for the build & test cycles in the Makefile provide two variants, one of them suffixed with -local . For example, make test will run unit tests in the Docker container, make test-local will run it natively on your local system. If you are going to use the virtualized toolchain, please bear in mind the following things: Your Kubernetes API server must listen on the interface of your local machine or VM, and not on 127.0.0.1 only. Your Kubernetes client configuration ( ~/.kube/config ) must not use an API URL that points to localhost or 127.0.0.1 . You can test whether the virtualized toolchain has access to your Kubernetes cluster by running make verify-kube-connect ( after you have setup your development environment, as described below), which will run kubectl version inside the Docker container used for running all tests. The Docker container for the virtualized toolchain will use the following local mounts from your workstation, and possibly modify its contents: ~/go/src - Your Go workspace's source directory (modifications expected) ~/.cache/go-build - Your Go build cache (modifications expected) ~/.kube - Your Kubernetes client configuration (no modifications) /tmp - Your system's temp directory (modifications expected) Setting up your development environment \u00b6 The following steps are required no matter whether you chose to use a virtualized or a local toolchain. Clone the ArgoCD repository from your personal fork on GitHub \u00b6 mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/argoproj cd ~/go/src/github.com/argoproj git clone https://github.com/yourghuser/argo-cd cd argo-cd Optional: Setup an additional Git remote \u00b6 While everyone has their own Git workflow, the author of this document recommends to create a remote called upstream in your local copy pointing to the original ArgoCD repository. This way, you can easily keep your local branches up-to-date by merging in latest changes from the ArgoCD repository, i.e. by doing a git pull upstream master in your locally checked out branch. To create the remote, run git remote add upstream https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd Install the must-have requirements \u00b6 Make sure you fulfill the pre-requisites above and run some preliminary tests. Neither of them should report an error. Run kubectl version Run docker version Run go version Build (or pull) the required Docker image \u00b6 Build the required Docker image by running make test-tools-image or pull the latest version by issuing docker pull argoproj/argocd-test-tools . The Dockerfile used to build these images can be found at test/container/Dockerfile . Test connection from build container to your K8s cluster \u00b6 Run make verify-kube-connect , it should execute without error. If you receive an error similar to the following: The connection to the server 127.0.0.1:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port? make: *** [Makefile:386: verify-kube-connect] Error 1 you should edit your ~/.kube/config and modify the server option to point to your correct K8s API (as described above). Using k3d \u00b6 k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s , a minimal Kubernetes distribution, in docker. Because it's running in a docker container, you're dealing with docker's internal networking rules when using k3d. A typical Kubernetes cluster running on your local machine is part of the same network that you're on so you can access it using kubectl . However, a Kubernetes cluster running within a docker container (in this case, the one launched by make) cannot access 0.0.0.0 from inside the container itself, when 0.0.0.0 is a network resource outside the container itself (and/or the container's network). This is the cost of a fully self-contained, disposable Kubernetes cluster. The following steps should help with a successful make verify-kube-connect execution. Find your host IP by executing ifconfig on Mac/Linux and ipconfig on Windows. For most users, the following command works to find the IP address. For Mac: IP=`ifconfig en0 | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | awk '{print $2}'` echo $IP For Linux: IP=`ifconfig eth0 | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | awk '{print $2}'` echo $IP Keep in mind that this IP is dynamically assigned by the router so if your router restarts for any reason, your IP might change. Edit your ~/.kube/config and replace 0.0.0.0 with the above IP address. Execute a kubectl version to make sure you can still connect to the Kubernetes API server via this new IP. Run make verify-kube-connect and check if it works. Finally, so that you don't have to keep updating your kube-config whenever you spin up a new k3d cluster, add --api-port $IP:6550 to your k3d cluster create command, where $IP is the value from step 1. An example command is provided here. k3d cluster create my - cluster -- wait -- k3s - server - arg '--disable=traefik' -- api - port $ IP : 6550 - p 443 : 443 @ loadbalancer The development cycle \u00b6 When you have developed and possibly manually tested the code you want to contribute, you should ensure that everything will build correctly. Commit your changes to the local copy of your Git branch and perform the following steps: Pull in all build dependencies \u00b6 As build dependencies change over time, you have to synchronize your development environment with the current specification. In order to pull in all required dependencies, issue: make dep-ui ArgoCD recently migrated to Go modules. Usually, dependencies will be downloaded on build time, but the Makefile provides two targets to download and vendor all dependencies: make mod-download will download all required Go modules and make mod-vendor will vendor those dependencies into the ArgoCD source tree Generate API glue code and other assets \u00b6 ArgoCD relies on Google's Protocol Buffers for its API, and this makes heavy use of auto-generated glue code and stubs. Whenever you touched parts of the API code, you must re-generate the auto generated code. Run make codegen , this might take a while Check if something has changed by running git status or git diff Commit any possible changes to your local Git branch, an appropriate commit message would be Changes from codegen , for example. Note There are a few non-obvious assets that are auto-generated. You should not change the autogenerated assets, as they will be overwritten by a subsequent run of make codegen . Instead, change their source files. Prominent examples of non-obvious auto-generated code are swagger.json or the installation manifest YAMLs. Build your code and run unit tests \u00b6 After the code glue has been generated, your code should build and the unit tests should run without any errors. Execute the following statements: make build make test These steps are non-modifying, so there's no need to check for changes afterwards. Lint your code base \u00b6 In order to keep a consistent code style in our source tree, your code must be well-formed in accordance to some widely accepted rules, which are applied by a Linter. The Linter might make some automatic changes to your code, such as indentation fixes. Some other errors reported by the Linter have to be fixed manually. Run make lint and observe any errors reported by the Linter Fix any of the errors reported and commit to your local branch Finally, after the Linter reports no errors anymore, run git status or git diff to check for any changes made automatically by Lint If there were automatic changes, commit them to your local branch If you touched UI code, you should also run the Yarn linter on it: Run make lint-ui Fix any of the errors reported by it Setting up a local toolchain \u00b6 For development, you can either use the fully virtualized toolchain provided as Docker images, or you can set up the toolchain on your local development machine. Due to the dynamic nature of requirements, you might want to stay with the virtualized environment. Install required dependencies and build-tools \u00b6 Note The installations instructions are valid for Linux hosts only. Mac instructions will follow shortly. For installing the tools required to build and test ArgoCD on your local system, we provide convenient installer scripts. By default, they will install binaries to /usr/local/bin on your system, which might require root privileges. You can change the target location by setting the BIN environment before running the installer scripts. For example, you can install the binaries into ~/go/bin (which should then be the first component in your PATH environment, i.e. export PATH=~/go/bin:$PATH ): make BIN = ~/go/bin install-tools-local Additionally, you have to install at least the following tools via your OS's package manager (this list might not be always up-to-date): Git LFS plugin GnuPG version 2 Install Go dependencies \u00b6 You need to pull in all required Go dependencies. To do so, run make mod-download-local make mod-vendor-local Test your build toolchain \u00b6 The first thing you can do whether your build toolchain is setup correctly is by generating the glue code for the API and after that, run a normal build: make codegen-local make build-local This should return without any error. Run unit-tests \u00b6 The next thing is to make sure that unit tests are running correctly on your system. These will require that all dependencies, such as Helm, Kustomize, Git, GnuPG, etc are correctly installed and fully functioning: make test-local Run end-to-end tests \u00b6 The final step is running the End-to-End testsuite, which makes sure that your Kubernetes dependencies are working properly. This will involve starting all of the ArgoCD components locally on your computer. The end-to-end tests consists of two parts: a server component, and a client component. First, start the End-to-End server: make start-e2e-local . This will spawn a number of processes and services on your system. When all components have started, run make test-e2e-local to run the end-to-end tests against your local services.

You will also need a working Kubernetes client ( kubectl ) configuration in your development environment.

The release process takes about 20 minutes, sometimes a little less, depending on the performance of GitHub Actions runners. The target release branch must already exist in the GitHub repository. If you for example want to create a release v1.7.0 , the corresponding release branch release-1.7 needs to exist, otherwise, the release cannot be built. Also, the trigger tag should always be created in the release branch, checked out in your local repository clone. Before triggering the release automation, the CHANGELOG.md should be updated with the latest information, and this change should be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository to the release branch. Afterward, the automation can be triggered. Manual steps before release creation: Update CHANGELOG.md with changes for this release Commit & push changes to CHANGELOG.md Prepare release notes (save to some file, or copy from Changelog) The automation will perform the following steps: Update VERSION file in the release branch Update manifests with image tags of the new version in the release branch Build the Docker image and push to Docker Hub Create a release tag in the GitHub repository Create a GitHub release and attach the required assets to it (CLI binaries, ...) Finally, it will the remove trigger tag from the repository again. Automation supports both, GA and pre-releases. The automation is triggered by pushing a tag to the repository. The tag must be in one of the following formats to trigger the GH workflow: GA: release-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> Pre-release: release-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>-rc<RC#> The tag must be an annotated tag, and it must contain the release notes in the commit message. Please note that Markdown uses # character for formatting, but Git uses it as comment char. To solve this, temporarily switch Git's comment char to something else, the ; character is recommended. For example, consider you have configured the Git remote for the repository to github.com/argoproj/argo-cd to be named upstream and are in your locally checked out repo: git config core.commentChar ';' git tag -a -F /path/to/release-notes.txt release-v1.6.0-rc2 git push upstream release-v1.6.0-rc2 git tag -d release-v1.6.0-rc2 git config core.commentChar '#' For convenience, there is a shell script in the tree that ensures all the pre-requisites are met and that the trigger is well-formed before pushing it to the GitHub repo. In summary, the modifications it does are: Create annotated trigger tag in your local repository Push the tag to the GitHub repository to trigger the workflow Remove trigger tag from your local repository The script can be found at hacks/trigger-release.sh and is used as follows: ./hacks/trigger-release.sh <version> <remote name> [ <release notes path> ] The <version> identifier needs to be specified without the release- prefix, so just specify it as v1.6.0-rc2 for example. The <remote name> specifies the name of the remote used to push to the GitHub repository. If you omit the <release notes path> , an editor will pop-up asking you to enter the tag's annotation so you can paste the release notes, save, and exit. It will also take care of temporarily configuring the core.commentChar and setting it back to its original state. :warning: It is strongly recommended to use this script to trigger the workflow instead of manually pushing a tag to the repository. Once the trigger tag is pushed to the repo, the GitHub workflow will start execution. You can follow its progress under the Actions tab, the name of the action is Create release . Don't get confused by the name of the running workflow, it will be the commit message of the latest commit to the master branch, this is a limitation of GH actions. The workflow performs necessary checks so that the release can be successfully built before the build actually starts. It will error when one of the prerequisites is not met, or if the release cannot be built (i.e. already exists, release notes invalid, etc etc). You can see a summary of what has failed in the job's overview page and more detailed errors in the output of the step that has failed. :warning: You cannot perform more than one release on the same release branch at the same time. For example, both v1.6.0 and v1.6.1 would operate on the release-1.6 branch. If you submit v1.6.1 while v1.6.0 is still executing, the release automation will not execute. You have to either cancel v1.6.0 before submitting v1.6.1 or wait until it has finished. You can execute releases on different release branches simultaneously, for example, v1.6.0 and v1.7.0-rc1 , without problems. Verifying automated release \u00b6 After the automatic release creation has finished, you should perform manual checks to see if the release came out correctly: Check status & output of the GitHub action Check https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases to see if the release has been correctly created and if all required assets are attached. Check whether the image has been published on DockerHub correctly If something went wrong \u00b6 If something went wrong, damage should be limited. Depending on the steps that have been performed, you will need to manually clean up. Delete the release tag (e.g. v1.6.0-rc2 ) created in the GitHub repository. This will immediately set the release (if created) to draft status, invisible to the general public. Delete the draft release (if created) from the Releases page on GitHub If Docker image has been pushed to DockerHub, delete it If commits have been performed to the release branch, revert them. Paths that could have been committed to are: VERSION manifests/* Post-process manual steps \u00b6 For now, the only manual steps left are to update stable tag in the GitHub repository to point to new the release (if appropriate) update the VERSION file on master if this is a new major release These may be automated as well in the future. Manual releasing \u00b6 The automatic release process does not interfere with the manual release process, since the trigger tag does not match a normal release tag. If you prefer to perform, manual release or if automatic release is for some reason broken, these are the steps: Make sure you are logged into Docker Hub: docker login Export the upstream repository and branch name, e.g.: REPO = upstream ; # or origin BRANCH = release-1.3 Set the VERSION environment variable: # release candidate VERSION = v1.3.0-rc1 # GA release VERSION = v1.3.1 Update VERSION and manifests with the new version: git checkout $BRANCH echo ${ VERSION : 1 } > VERSION make dev-tools-image make manifests IMAGE_TAG = $VERSION git commit -am \"Update manifests to $VERSION \" git tag $VERSION Build, and push release to Docker Hub git clean -fd make release IMAGE_NAMESPACE = argoproj IMAGE_TAG = $VERSION DOCKER_PUSH = true git push $REPO $BRANCH git push $REPO $VERSION Update GitHub releases with: Getting started (copy from the previous release) Changelog Binaries (e.g. dist/argocd-darwin-amd64 ).

This will greatly speed up development, as you don't have to constantly build, push and install new ArgoCD Docker images with your latest changes. You will still need a working Kubernetes cluster, as described in the Contribution Guide , where ArgoCD will store all of its resources. If you followed the Contribution Guide in setting up your toolchain, you can run ArgoCD locally with these simple steps: Install ArgoCD resources to your cluster \u00b6 First push the installation manifest into argocd namespace: kubectl create namespace argocd kubectl apply -n argocd --force -f manifests/install.yaml Scale down any ArgoCD instance in your cluster \u00b6 Make sure that ArgoCD is not running in your development cluster by scaling down the deployments: kubectl -n argocd scale statefulset/argocd-application-controller --replicas 0 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-dex-server --replicas 0 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-repo-server --replicas 0 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-server --replicas 0 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-redis --replicas 0 Start local services \u00b6 Before starting local services, make sure you are present in argocd namespace. When you use the virtualized toolchain, starting local services is as simple as running make start This will start all ArgoCD services and the UI in a Docker container and expose the following ports to your host: The ArgoCD API server on port 8080 The ArgoCD UI server on port 4000 You can now use either the web UI by pointing your browser to http://localhost:4000 or use the CLI against the API at http://localhost:8080 . Be sure to use the --insecure and --plaintext options to the CLI. As an alternative to using the above command line parameters each time you call argocd CLI, you can set the following environment variables: export ARGOCD_SERVER = 127 .0.0.1:8080 export ARGOCD_OPTS = \"--plaintext --insecure\" Scale up ArgoCD in your cluster \u00b6 Once you have finished testing your changes locally and want to bring back ArgoCD in your development cluster, simply scale the deployments up again: kubectl -n argocd scale statefulset/argocd-application-controller --replicas 1 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-dex-server --replicas 1 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-repo-server --replicas 1 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-server --replicas 1 kubectl -n argocd scale deployment/argocd-redis --replicas 1 Run your own ArgoCD images on your cluster \u00b6 For your final tests, it might be necessary to build your own images and run them in your development cluster.

Sometimes, it may be desired to use a specific version of a tool other than what Argo CD bundles. Some reasons to do this might be: To upgrade/downgrade to a specific version of a tool due to bugs or bug fixes. To install additional dependencies which to be used by kustomize's configmap/secret generators (e.g. curl, vault, gpg, AWS CLI) To install a config management plugin As the Argo CD repo-server is the single service responsible for generating Kubernetes manifests, it can be customized to use alternative toolchain required by your environment. Adding Tools Via Volume Mounts \u00b6 The first technique is to use an init container and a volumeMount to copy a different version of a tool into the repo-server container. In the following example, an init container is overwriting the helm binary with a different version than what is bundled in Argo CD: spec : # 1. Define an emptyDir volume which will hold the custom binaries volumes : - name : custom-tools emptyDir : {} # 2. Use an init container to download/copy custom binaries into the emptyDir initContainers : - name : download-tools image : alpine:3.8 command : [ sh , -c ] args : - wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.12.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xvzf - && mv linux-amd64/helm /custom-tools/ volumeMounts : - mountPath : /custom-tools name : custom-tools # 3.

Also, ConfigMap and Secret resources need to be named as shown in the table above. For Application and AppProject resources, the name of the resource equals the name of the application or project within ArgoCD. This also means that application and project names are unique within the same ArgoCD installation - you cannot i.e. have the same application name for two different applications. A note about ConfigMap resources Be sure to annotate your ConfigMap resources using the label app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd , otherwise ArgoCD will not be able to use them. Applications \u00b6 The Application CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a deployed application instance in an environment. It is defined by two key pieces of information: source reference to the desired state in Git (repository, revision, path, environment) destination reference to the target cluster and namespace. For the cluster one of server or name can be used, but not both (which will result in an error). Behind the hood when the server is missing, it is being calculated based on the name and then the server is used for any operations. A minimal Application spec is as follows: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook namespace : argocd spec : project : default source : repoURL : https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git targetRevision : HEAD path : guestbook destination : server : https://kubernetes.default.svc namespace : guestbook See application.yaml for additional fields. As long as you have completed the first step of Getting Started , you can already apply this with kubectl apply -n argocd -f application.yaml and Argo CD will start deploying the guestbook application. Note The namespace must match the namespace of your Argo cd, typically this is argocd . Note When creating an application from a Helm repository, the chart attribute must be specified instead of the path attribute within spec.source . spec : source : repoURL : https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm chart : argo Warning By default, deleting an application will not perform a cascade delete, thereby deleting its resources. You must add the finalizer if you want this behaviour - which you may well not want. metadata : finalizers : - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io App of Apps \u00b6 You can create an app that creates other apps, which in turn can create other apps. This allows you to declaratively manage a group of app that can be deployed and configured in concert. See cluster bootstrapping . Projects \u00b6 The AppProject CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a logical grouping of applications. It is defined by the following key pieces of information: sourceRepos reference to the repositories that applications within the project can pull manifests from. destinations reference to clusters and namespaces that applications within the project can deploy into (don't use the name field, only server is being matched). roles list of entities with definitions of their access to resources within the project. An example spec is as follows: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AppProject metadata : name : my-project namespace : argocd # Finalizer that ensures that project is not deleted until it is not referenced by any application finalizers : - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io spec : description : Example Project # Allow manifests to deploy from any Git repos sourceRepos : - '*' # Only permit applications to deploy to the guestbook namespace in the same cluster destinations : - namespace : guestbook server : https://kubernetes.default.svc # Deny all cluster-scoped resources from being created, except for Namespace clusterResourceWhitelist : - group : '' kind : Namespace # Allow all namespaced-scoped resources to be created, except for ResourceQuota, LimitRange, NetworkPolicy namespaceResourceBlacklist : - group : '' kind : ResourceQuota - group : '' kind : LimitRange - group : '' kind : NetworkPolicy # Deny all namespaced-scoped resources from being created, except for Deployment and StatefulSet namespaceResourceWhitelist : - group : 'apps' kind : Deployment - group : 'apps' kind : StatefulSet roles : # A role which provides read-only access to all applications in the project - name : read-only description : Read-only privileges to my-project policies : - p, proj:my-project:read-only, applications, get, my-project/*, allow groups : - my-oidc-group # A role which provides sync privileges to only the guestbook-dev application, e.g. to provide # sync privileges to a CI system - name : ci-role description : Sync privileges for guestbook-dev policies : - p, proj:my-project:ci-role, applications, sync, my-project/guestbook-dev, allow # NOTE: JWT tokens can only be generated by the API server and the token is not persisted # anywhere by Argo CD. It can be prematurely revoked by removing the entry from this list. jwtTokens : - iat : 1535390316 Repositories \u00b6 Note Some Git hosters - notably GitLab and possibly on-premise GitLab instances as well - require you to specify the .git suffix in the repository URL, otherwise they will send a HTTP 301 redirect to the repository URL suffixed with .git . ArgoCD will not follow these redirects, so you have to adapt your repository URL to be suffixed with .git . Repository credentials are stored in secret. Use following steps to configure a repo: Create secret which contains repository credentials. Consider using bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets to store encrypted secret definition as a Kubernetes manifest. Register repository in the argocd-cm config map. Each repository must have url field and, depending on whether you connect using HTTPS or SSH, usernameSecret and passwordSecret (for HTTPS) or sshPrivateKeySecret (for SSH). Example for HTTPS: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : repositories : | - url: https://github.com/argoproj/my-private-repository passwordSecret: name: my-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: my-secret key: username Example for SSH: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : repositories : | - url: git@github.com:argoproj/my-private-repository sshPrivateKeySecret: name: my-secret key: sshPrivateKey Tip The Kubernetes documentation has instructions for creating a secret containing a private key . Repository Credentials \u00b6 Earlier than v1.4 If you want to use the same credentials for multiple repositories, you can use repository.credentials : apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : repositories : | - url: https://github.com/argoproj/private-repo - url: https://github.com/argoproj/other-private-repo repository.credentials : | - url: https://github.com/argoproj passwordSecret: name: my-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: my-secret key: username - url: git@github.com:argoproj-labs sshPrivateKeySecret: name: my-secret key: sshPrivateKey Argo CD will only use the credentials if you omit usernameSecret , passwordSecret , and sshPrivateKeySecret fields ( insecureIgnoreHostKey is ignored) or if your repository is not listed in repositories . A credential may be match if it's URL is the prefix of the repository's URL. The means that credentials may match, e.g in the above example both https://github.com/argoproj and https://github.com would match. Argo CD selects the first one that matches. Tip Order your credentials with the most specific at the top and the least specific at the bottom. A complete example. apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : repositories : | # this has it's own credentials - url: https://github.com/argoproj/private-repo passwordSecret: name: private-repo-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: private-repo-secret key: username sshPrivateKeySecret: name: private-repo-secret key: sshPrivateKey - url: https://github.com/argoproj/other-private-repo - url: https://github.com/otherproj/another-private-repo repository.credentials : | # this will be used for the second repo - url: https://github.com/argoproj passwordSecret: name: other-private-repo-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: other-private-repo-secret key: username sshPrivateKeySecret: name: other-private-repo-secret key: sshPrivateKey # this will be used for the third repo - url: https://github.com passwordSecret: name: another-private-repo-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: another-private-repo-secret key: username sshPrivateKeySecret: name: another-private-repo-secret key: sshPrivateKey v1.4 or later If you want to use the same credentials for multiple repositories, you can use repository.credentials to configure credential templates. Credential templates can carry the same credentials information as repositories. apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : repositories : | - url: https://github.com/argoproj/private-repo - url: https://github.com/argoproj/other-private-repo repository.credentials : | - url: https://github.com/argoproj passwordSecret: name: my-secret key: password usernameSecret: name: my-secret key: username In the above example, every repository accessed via HTTPS whose URL is prefixed with https://github.com/argoproj would use a username stored in the key username and a password stored in the key password of the secret my-secret for connecting to Git. In order for ArgoCD to use a credential template for any given repository, the following conditions must be met: The repository must either not be configured at all, or if configured, must not contain any credential information (i.e. contain none of sshPrivateKeySecret , usernameSecret , passwordSecret ) The URL configured for a credential template (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj ) must match as prefix for the repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps ). Note Matching credential template URL prefixes is done on a best match effort, so the longest (best) match will take precedence. The order of definition is not important, as opposed to pre v1.4 configuration. The following keys are valid to refer to credential secrets: SSH repositories \u00b6 sshPrivateKeySecret refers to a secret where an SSH private key is stored for accessing the repositories HTTPS repositories \u00b6 usernameSecret and passwordSecret refer to secrets where username and/or password are stored for accessing the repositories tlsClientCertData and tlsClientCertKey refer to secrets where a TLS client certificate ( tlsClientCertData ) and the corresponding private key tlsClientCertKey are stored for accessing the repositories Repositories using self-signed TLS certificates (or are signed by custom CA) \u00b6 v1.2 or later You can manage the TLS certificates used to verify the authenticity of your repository servers in a ConfigMap object named argocd-tls-certs-cm . The data section should contain a map, with the repository server's hostname part (not the complete URL) as key, and the certificate(s) in PEM format as data. So, if you connect to a repository with the URL https://server.example.com/repos/my-repo , you should use server.example.com as key. The certificate data should be either the server's certificate (in case of self-signed certificate) or the certificate of the CA that was used to sign the server's certificate. You can configure multiple certificates for each server, e.g. if you are having a certificate roll-over planned. If there are no dedicated certificates configured for a repository server, the system's default trust store is used for validating the server's repository. This should be good enough for most (if not all) public Git repository services such as GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket as well as most privately hosted sites which use certificates from well-known CAs, including Let's Encrypt certificates.

It will create files for each data key in the mount path directory, so above example would leave the file /app/config/tls/server.example.com , which contains the certificate data. It might take a while for changes in the ConfigMap to be reflected in your pods, depending on your Kubernetes configuration. SSH known host public keys \u00b6 If you are connecting repositories via SSH, ArgoCD will need to know the SSH known hosts public key of the repository servers. You can manage the SSH known hosts data in the ConfigMap named argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm . This ConfigMap contains a single key/value pair, with ssh_known_hosts as the key and the actual public keys of the SSH servers as data. As opposed to TLS configuration, the public key(s) of each single repository server ArgoCD will connect via SSH must be configured, otherwise the connections to the repository will fail. There is no fallback. The data can be copied from any existing ssh_known_hosts file, or from the output of the ssh-keyscan utility. The basic format is <servername> <keydata> , one entry per line. An example ConfigMap object: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : ssh_known_hosts : | bitbucket.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAubiN81eDcafrgMeLzaFPsw2kNvEcqTKl/VqLat/MaB33pZy0y3rJZtnqwR2qOOvbwKZYKiEO1O6VqNEBxKvJJelCq0dTXWT5pbO2gDXC6h6QDXCaHo6pOHGPUy+YBaGQRGuSusMEASYiWunYN0vCAI8QaXnWMXNMdFP3jHAJH0eDsoiGnLPBlBp4TNm6rYI74nMzgz3B9IikW4WVK+dc8KZJZWYjAuORU3jc1c/NPskD2ASinf8v3xnfXeukU0sJ5N6m5E8VLjObPEO+mN2t/FZTMZLiFqPWc/ALSqnMnnhwrNi2rbfg/rd/IpL8Le3pSBne8+seeFVBoGqzHM9yXw== github.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAq2A7hRGmdnm9tUDbO9IDSwBK6TbQa+PXYPCPy6rbTrTtw7PHkccKrpp0yVhp5HdEIcKr6pLlVDBfOLX9QUsyCOV0wzfjIJNlGEYsdlLJizHhbn2mUjvSAHQqZETYP81eFzLQNnPHt4EVVUh7VfDESU84KezmD5QlWpXLmvU31/yMf+Se8xhHTvKSCZIFImWwoG6mbUoWf9nzpIoaSjB+weqqUUmpaaasXVal72J+UX2B+2RPW3RcT0eOzQgqlJL3RKrTJvdsjE3JEAvGq3lGHSZXy28G3skua2SmVi/w4yCE6gbODqnTWlg7+wC604ydGXA8VJiS5ap43JXiUFFAaQ== gitlab.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBFSMqzJeV9rUzU4kWitGjeR4PWSa29SPqJ1fVkhtj3Hw9xjLVXVYrU9QlYWrOLXBpQ6KWjbjTDTdDkoohFzgbEY= gitlab.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAfuCHKVTjquxvt6CM6tdG4SLp1Btn/nOeHHE5UOzRdf gitlab.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCsj2bNKTBSpIYDEGk9KxsGh3mySTRgMtXL583qmBpzeQ+jqCMRgBqB98u3z++J1sKlXHWfM9dyhSevkMwSbhoR8XIq/U0tCNyokEi/ueaBMCvbcTHhO7FcwzY92WK4Yt0aGROY5qX2UKSeOvuP4D6TPqKF1onrSzH9bx9XUf2lEdWT/ia1NEKjunUqu1xOB/StKDHMoX4/OKyIzuS0q/T1zOATthvasJFoPrAjkohTyaDUz2LN5JoH839hViyEG82yB+MjcFV5MU3N1l1QL3cVUCh93xSaua1N85qivl+siMkPGbO5xR/En4iEY6K2XPASUEMaieWVNTRCtJ4S8H+9 ssh.dev.azure.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC7Hr1oTWqNqOlzGJOfGJ4NakVyIzf1rXYd4d7wo6jBlkLvCA4odBlL0mDUyZ0/QUfTTqeu+tm22gOsv+VrVTMk6vwRU75gY/y9ut5Mb3bR5BV58dKXyq9A9UeB5Cakehn5Zgm6x1mKoVyf+FFn26iYqXJRgzIZZcZ5V6hrE0Qg39kZm4az48o0AUbf6Sp4SLdvnuMa2sVNwHBboS7EJkm57XQPVU3/QpyNLHbWDdzwtrlS+ez30S3AdYhLKEOxAG8weOnyrtLJAUen9mTkol8oII1edf7mWWbWVf0nBmly21+nZcmCTISQBtdcyPaEno7fFQMDD26/s0lfKob4Kw8H vs-ssh.visualstudio.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC7Hr1oTWqNqOlzGJOfGJ4NakVyIzf1rXYd4d7wo6jBlkLvCA4odBlL0mDUyZ0/QUfTTqeu+tm22gOsv+VrVTMk6vwRU75gY/y9ut5Mb3bR5BV58dKXyq9A9UeB5Cakehn5Zgm6x1mKoVyf+FFn26iYqXJRgzIZZcZ5V6hrE0Qg39kZm4az48o0AUbf6Sp4SLdvnuMa2sVNwHBboS7EJkm57XQPVU3/QpyNLHbWDdzwtrlS+ez30S3AdYhLKEOxAG8weOnyrtLJAUen9mTkol8oII1edf7mWWbWVf0nBmly21+nZcmCTISQBtdcyPaEno7fFQMDD26/s0lfKob4Kw8H Note The argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm ConfigMap will be mounted as a volume at the mount path /app/config/ssh in the pods of argocd-server and argocd-repo-server . It will create a file ssh_known_hosts in that directory, which contains the SSH known hosts data used by ArgoCD for connecting to Git repositories via SSH. It might take a while for changes in the ConfigMap to be reflected in your pods, depending on your Kubernetes configuration. Clusters \u00b6 Cluster credentials are stored in secrets same as repository credentials but does not require entry in argocd-cm config map. Each secret must have label argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster . The secret data must include following fields: name - cluster name server - cluster api server url namespaces - optional comma-separated list of namespaces which are accessible in that cluster. Cluster level resources would be ignored if namespace list is not empty. config - JSON representation of following data structure: # Basic authentication settings username : string password : string # Bearer authentication settings bearerToken : string # IAM authentication configuration awsAuthConfig : clusterName : string roleARN : string # Configure external command to supply client credentials # See https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api#ExecConfig execProviderConfig : command : string args : [ string ] env : { key : value } apiVersion : string installHint : string # Transport layer security configuration settings tlsClientConfig : # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate file). caData : string # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate file). certData : string # Server should be accessed without verifying the TLS certificate insecure : boolean # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate key file). keyData : string # ServerName is passed to the server for SNI and is used in the client to check server # certificates against. If ServerName is empty, the hostname used to contact the # server is used. serverName : string Note that if you specify a command to run under execProviderConfig , that command must be available in the ArgoCD image. See BYOI (Build Your Own Image) . Cluster secret example: apiVersion : v1 kind : Secret metadata : name : mycluster-secret labels : argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type : cluster type : Opaque stringData : name : mycluster.com server : https://mycluster.com config : | { \"bearerToken\": \"<authentication token>\", \"tlsClientConfig\": { \"insecure\": false, \"caData\": \"<base64 encoded certificate>\" } } Helm Chart Repositories \u00b6 Non standard Helm Chart repositories have to be registered under the repositories key in the argocd-cm ConfigMap. Each repository must have url , type and name fields. For private Helm repos you may need to configure access credentials and HTTPS settings using usernameSecret , passwordSecret , caSecret , certSecret and keySecret fields. Example: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-cm namespace : argocd labels : app.kubernetes.io/name : argocd-cm app.kubernetes.io/part-of : argocd data : # v1.2 or earlier use `helm.repositories` helm.repositories : | - url: https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-prerelease/daily-build/master-latest-daily/charts name: istio.io # v1.3 or later use `repositories` with `type: helm` repositories : | - type: helm url: https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-prerelease/daily-build/master-latest-daily/charts name: istio.io - type: helm url: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm name: argo usernameSecret: name: my-secret key: username passwordSecret: name: my-secret key: password caSecret: name: my-secret key: ca certSecret: name: my-secret key: cert keySecret: name: my-secret key: key Resource Exclusion/Inclusion \u00b6 Resources can be excluded from discovery and sync so that ArgoCD is unaware of them. For example, events.k8s.io and metrics.k8s.io are always excluded. Use cases: You have temporal issues and you want to exclude problematic resources. There are many of a kind of resources that impacts ArgoCD's performance. Restrict ArgoCD's access to certain kinds of resources, e.g. secrets. See security.md#cluster-rbac . To configure this, edit the argcd-cm config map: kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocd Add resource.exclusions , e.g.: apiVersion : v1 data : resource.exclusions : | - apiGroups: - \"*\" kinds: - \"*\" clusters: - https://192.168.0.20 kind : ConfigMap The resource.exclusions node is a list of objects. Each object can have: apiGroups A list of globs to match the API group. kinds A list of kinds to match. Can be \"*\" to match all. cluster A list of globs to match the cluster. If all three match, then the resource is ignored. In addition to exclusions, you might configure the list of included resources using the resource.inclusions setting.

The data section should contain a map, with the repository server's hostname part (not the complete URL) as key, and the certificate(s) in PEM format as data. So, if you connect to a repository with the URL https://server.example.com/repos/my-repo , you should use server.example.com as key. The certificate data should be either the server's certificate (in case of self-signed certificate) or the certificate of the CA that was used to sign the server's certificate. You can configure multiple certificates for each server, e.g. if you are having a certificate roll-over planned. If there are no dedicated certificates configured for a repository server, the system's default trust store is used for validating the server's repository. This should be good enough for most (if not all) public Git repository services such as GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket as well as most privately hosted sites which use certificates from well-known CAs, including Let's Encrypt certificates.

The fork can fail due to lack of memory and limit on the number of OS threads.

This operation is happening pretty frequently and might fail. To avoid failed syncs use ARGOCD_GIT_ATTEMPTS_COUNT environment variable to retry failed requests. argocd-repo-server Every 3m (by default) Argo CD checks for changes to the app manifests. Argo CD assumes by default that manifests only change when the repo changes, so it caches generated manifests (for 24h by default). With Kustomize remote bases, or Helm patch releases, the manifests can change even though the repo has not changed. By reducing the cache time, you can get the changes without waiting for 24h. Use --repo-cache-expiration duration , and we'd suggest in low volume environments you try '1h'. Bear in mind this will negate the benefit of caching if set too low. metrics: argocd_git_request_total - Number of git requests. The metric provides two tags: repo - Git repo URL; request_type - ls-remote or fetch . ARGOCD_ENABLE_GRPC_TIME_HISTOGRAM (v1.8+) - environment variable that enables collecting RPC performance metrics. Enable it if you need to troubleshoot performance issue. Note: metric is expensive to both query and store! argocd-application-controller \u00b6 settings: The argocd-application-controller uses argocd-repo-server to get generated manifests and Kubernetes API server to get actual cluster state. each controller replica uses two separate queues to process application reconciliation (milliseconds) and app syncing (seconds). Number of queue processors for each queue is controlled by --status-processors (20 by default) and --operation-processors (10 by default) flags. Increase number of processors if your Argo CD instance manages too many applications. For 1000 application we use 50 for --status-processors and 25 for --operation-processors The manifest generation typically takes the most time during reconciliation. The duration of manifest generation is limited to make sure controller refresh queue does not overflow. The app reconciliation fails with Context deadline exceeded error if manifest generating taking too much time. As workaround increase value of --repo-server-timeout-seconds and consider scaling up argocd-repo-server deployment. The controller uses kubectl fork/exec to push changes into the cluster and to convert resource from preferred version into user specified version (e.g. Deployment apps/v1 into extensions/v1beta1 ). Same as config management tool kubectl fork/exec might cause pod OOM kill. Use --kubectl-parallelism-limit flag to limit number of allowed concurrent kubectl fork/execs. The controller uses Kubernetes watch APIs to maintain lightweight Kubernetes cluster cache. This allows to avoid querying Kubernetes during app reconciliation and significantly improve performance. For performance reasons controller monitors and caches only preferred the version of a resource. During reconciliation, the controller might have to convert cached resource from preferred version into a version of the resource stored in Git. If kubectl convert fails because conversion is not supported than controller fallback to Kubernetes API query which slows down reconciliation. In this case advice user-preferred resource version in Git. The controller polls Git every 3m by default. You can increase this duration using --app-resync seconds to reduce polling. If the controller is managing too many clusters and uses too much memory then you can shard clusters across multiple controller replicas. To enable sharding increase the number of replicas in argocd-application-controller StatefulSet and repeat number of replicas in ARGOCD_CONTROLLER_REPLICAS environment variable. The strategic merge patch below demonstrates changes required to configure two controller replicas. apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : StatefulSet metadata : name : argocd-application-controller spec : replicas : 2 template : spec : containers : - name : argocd-application-controller env : - name : ARGOCD_CONTROLLER_REPLICAS value : \"2\" ARGOCD_ENABLE_GRPC_TIME_HISTOGRAM (v1.8+)- environment variable that enables collecting RPC performance metrics.

Can be used to build reconciliation duration heat map to get high-level reconciliation performance picture. argocd_app_k8s_request_total - number of k8s requests per application. The number of fallback Kubernetes API queries - useful to identify which application has a resource with non-preferred version and causes performance issues. argocd-server \u00b6 The argocd-server is stateless and probably least likely to cause issues. You might consider increasing number of replicas to 3 or more to ensure there is no downtime during upgrades. settings: The ARGOCD_GRPC_MAX_SIZE_MB environment variable allows specifying the max size of the server response message in megabytes. The default value is 200. You might need to increase for an Argo CD instance that manages 3000+ applications. argocd-dex-server, argocd-redis \u00b6 The argocd-dex-server uses an in-memory database, and two or more instances would have inconsistent data. argocd-redis is pre-configured with the understanding of only three total redis servers/sentinels. Monorepo Scaling Considerations \u00b6 Argo CD repo server maintains one repository clone locally and use it for application manifest generation. If the manifest generation requires to change a file in the local repository clone then only one concurrent manifest generation per server instance is allowed. This limitation might significantly slowdown Argo CD if you have a mono repository with multiple applications (50+). Enable Concurrent Processing \u00b6 Argo CD determines if manifest generation might change local files in the local repository clone based on config management tool and application settings. If the manifest generation has no side effects then requests are processed in parallel without the performance penalty. Following are known cases that might cause slowness and workarounds: Multiple Helm based applications pointing to the same directory in one Git repository: ensure that your Helm chart don't have conditional dependencies and create .argocd-allow-concurrency file in chart directory. Multiple Custom plugin based applications: avoid creating temporal files during manifest generation and and create .argocd-allow-concurrency file in app directory. Multiple Kustomize or Ksonnet applications in same repository with parameter overrides : sorry, no workaround for now. Webhook and Manifest Paths Annotation \u00b6 Argo CD aggressively caches generated manifests and uses repository commit SHA as a cache key. A new commit to the Git repository invalidates cache for all applications configured in the repository that again negatively affect mono repositories with multiple applications. You might use webhooks \u29c9 and argocd.argoproj.io/manifest-generate-paths Application CRD annotation to solve this problem and improve performance. The argocd.argoproj.io/manifest-generate-paths contains a semicolon-separated list of paths within the Git repository that are used during manifest generation. The webhook compares paths specified in the annotation with the changed files specified in the webhook payload. If non of the changed files are located in the paths then webhook don't trigger application reconciliation and re-uses previously generated manifests cache for a new commit. Installations that use a different repo for each app are not subject to this behavior and will likely get no benefit from using these annotations. Note Installations with a large number of apps should also set the --app-resync flag in the argocd-application-controller process to a larger value to reduce automatic refreshes based on git polling. The exact value is a trade-off between reduced work and app sync in case of a missed webhook event. For most cases 1800 (30m) or 3600 (1h) is a good trade-off. Note Application manifest paths annotation support depends on the git provider used for the Application. It is currently only supported for GitHub, GitLab, and Gogs based repos Relative path The annotation might contains relative path. In this case the path is considered relative to the path specified in the application source: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook namespace : argocd annotations : # resolves to the 'guestbook' directory argocd.argoproj.io/manifest-generate-paths : . spec : source : repoURL : https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git targetRevision : HEAD path : guestbook # ...

Edit the argocd-server deployment to add the --rootpath=/argo-cd flag to the argocd-server command. apiVersion : getambassador.io/v2 kind : Mapping metadata : name : argocd-server namespace : argocd spec : prefix : /argo-cd rewrite : /argo-cd service : argocd-server:443 Login with the argocd CLI using the extra --grpc-web-root-path flag for non-root paths. argocd login <host>:<port> --grpc-web-root-path /argo-cd Contour \u00b6 The Contour ingress controller can terminate TLS ingress traffic at the edge. The Argo CD API server should be run with TLS disabled. Edit the argocd-server Deployment to add the --insecure flag to the argocd-server container command. It is also possible to provide an internal-only ingress path and an external-only ingress path by deploying two instances of Contour: one behind a private-subnet LoadBalancer service and one behind a public-subnet LoadBalancer service. The private Contour deployment will pick up Ingresses annotated with kubernetes.io/ingress.class: contour-external and the public Contour deployment will pick up Ingresses annotated with kubernetes.io/ingress.class: contour-external . This provides the opportunity to deploy the Argo CD UI privately but still allow for SSO callbacks to succeed. Private Argo CD UI with Multiple Ingress Objects and BYO Certificate \u00b6 Since Contour Ingress supports only a single protocol per Ingress object, define three Ingress objects. One for private HTTP/HTTPS, one for private gRPC, and one for public HTTPS SSO callbacks. Internal HTTP/HTTPS Ingress: apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-http annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : contour-internal ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect : \"true\" spec : rules : - host : internal.path.to.argocd.io http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : http tls : - hosts : - internal.path.to.argocd.io secretName : your-certificate-name Internal gRPC Ingress: apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-grpc annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : contour-internal spec : rules : - host : grpc-internal.path.to.argocd.io http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : https tls : - hosts : - grpc-internal.path.to.argocd.io secretName : your-certificate-name External HTTPS SSO Callback Ingress: apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-external-callback-http annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : contour-external ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect : \"true\" spec : rules : - host : external.path.to.argocd.io http : paths : - path : /api/dex/callback backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : http tls : - hosts : - external.path.to.argocd.io secretName : your-certificate-name The argocd-server Service needs to be annotated with projectcontour.io/upstream-protocol.h2c: \"https,443\" to wire up the gRPC protocol proxying. The API server should then be run with TLS disabled. Edit the argocd-server deployment to add the --insecure flag to the argocd-server command: spec : template : spec : containers : - name : argocd-server command : - /argocd-server - --staticassets - /shared/app - --repo-server - argocd-repo-server:8081 - --insecure kubernetes/ingress-nginx \u00b6 Option 1: SSL-Passthrough \u00b6 Argo CD serves multiple protocols (gRPC/HTTPS) on the same port (443), this provides a challenge when attempting to define a single nginx ingress object and rule for the argocd-service, since the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol annotation accepts only a single value for the backend protocol (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, GRPC, GRPCS). In order to expose the Argo CD API server with a single ingress rule and hostname, the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough annotation must be used to passthrough TLS connections and terminate TLS at the Argo CD API server. apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-ingress namespace : argocd annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect : \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough : \"true\" spec : rules : - host : argocd.example.com http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : https The above rule terminates TLS at the Argo CD API server, which detects the protocol being used, and responds appropriately. Note that the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough annotation requires that the --enable-ssl-passthrough flag be added to the command line arguments to nginx-ingress-controller . SSL-Passthrough with cert-manager and Let's Encrypt \u00b6 apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-ingress namespace : argocd annotations : cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer : letsencrypt-prod kubernetes.io/ingress.class : nginx kubernetes.io/tls-acme : \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough : \"true\" # If you encounter a redirect loop or are getting a 307 response code # then you need to force the nginx ingress to connect to the backend using HTTPS. # # nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"HTTPS\" spec : rules : - host : argocd.example.com http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : https path : / tls : - hosts : - argocd.example.com secretName : argocd-secret # do not change, this is provided by Argo CD Option 2: Multiple Ingress Objects And Hosts \u00b6 Since ingress-nginx Ingress supports only a single protocol per Ingress object, an alternative way would be to define two Ingress objects. One for HTTP/HTTPS, and the other for gRPC: HTTP/HTTPS Ingress: apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-http-ingress namespace : argocd annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : \"nginx\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect : \"true\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol : \"HTTP\" spec : rules : - http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : http host : argocd.example.com tls : - hosts : - argocd.example.com secretName : argocd-secret # do not change, this is provided by Argo CD gRPC Ingress: apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : argocd-server-grpc-ingress namespace : argocd annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : \"nginx\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol : \"GRPC\" spec : rules : - http : paths : - backend : serviceName : argocd-server servicePort : https host : grpc.argocd.example.com tls : - hosts : - grpc.argocd.example.com secretName : argocd-secret # do not change, this is provided by Argo CD The API server should then be run with TLS disabled.

However it allows TLS termination to happen at the ingress controller. Traefik (v2.2) \u00b6 Traefik can be used as an edge router and provide TLS termination within the same deployment. It currently has an advantage over NGINX in that it can terminate both TCP and HTTP connections on the same port meaning you do not require multiple hosts or paths. The API server should be run with TLS disabled. Edit the argocd-server deployment to add the --insecure flag to the argocd-server command. IngressRoute CRD \u00b6 apiVersion : traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind : IngressRoute metadata : name : argocd-server namespace : argocd spec : entryPoints : - websecure routes : - kind : Rule match : Host(`argocd.example.com`) priority : 10 services : - name : argocd-server port : 80 - kind : Rule match : Host(`argocd.example.com`) && Headers(`Content-Type`, `application/grpc`) priority : 11 services : - name : argocd-server port : 80 scheme : h2c tls : certResolver : default options : {} AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) And Classic ELB (HTTP Mode) \u00b6 ALBs and Classic ELBs don't fully support HTTP2/gRPC, which is used by the argocd CLI. Thus, when using an AWS load balancer, either Classic ELB in passthrough mode is needed, or NLBs. $ argocd login <host>:<port> --grpc-web Authenticating through multiple layers of authenticating reverse proxies \u00b6 ArgoCD endpoints may be protected by one or more reverse proxies layers, in that case, you can provide additional headers through the argocd CLI --header parameter to authenticate through those layers. $ argocd login <host>:<port> --header 'x-token1:foo' --header 'x-token2:bar' # can be repeated multiple times $ argocd login <host>:<port> --header 'x-token1:foo,x-token2:bar' # headers can also be comma separated ArgoCD Server and UI Root Path (v1.5.3) \u00b6 ArgoCD server and UI can be configured to be available under a non-root path (e.g. /argo-cd ). To do this, add the --rootpath flag into the argocd-server deployment command: spec : template : spec : name : argocd-server containers : - command : - /argocd-server - --staticassets - /shared/app - --repo-server - argocd-repo-server:8081 - --rootpath - /argo-cd NOTE: The flag --rootpath changes both API Server and UI base URL. Example nginx.conf: worker_processes 1 ; events { worker_connections 1024 ; } http { sendfile on ; server { listen 443 ; location /argo-cd/ { proxy_pass https : // localhost : 8080 / argo-cd / ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name ; # buffering should be disabled for api/v1/stream/applications to support chunked response proxy_buffering off ; } } } Flag --grpc-web-root-path is used to provide a non-root path (e.g. /argo-cd) $ argocd login <host>:<port> --grpc-web-root-path /argo-cd UI Base Path \u00b6 If the Argo CD UI is available under a non-root path (e.g. /argo-cd instead of / ) then the UI path should be configured in the API server. To configure the UI path add the --basehref flag into the argocd-server deployment command: spec : template : spec : name : argocd-server containers : - command : - /argocd-server - --staticassets - /shared/app - --repo-server - argocd-repo-server:8081 - --basehref - /argo-cd NOTE: The flag --basehref only changes the UI base URL. The API server will keep using the / path so you need to add a URL rewrite rule to the proxy config. Example nginx.conf with URL rewrite: worker_processes 1 ; events { worker_connections 1024 ; } http { sendfile on ; server { listen 443 ; location /argo-cd { rewrite /argo-cd/(.*) /$1 break ; proxy_pass https : // localhost : 8080 ; proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name ; # buffering should be disabled for api/v1/stream/applications to support chunked response proxy_buffering off ; } } }","title":"Ingress Configuration"},{"location":"operator-manual/ingress/#ingress-configuration","text":"Argo CD runs both a gRPC server (used by the CLI), as well as a HTTP/HTTPS server (used by the UI).

Kube Watch - a Kubernetes watcher that could publishes notification to Slack/hipchat/mattermost/flock channels. It watches the cluster for resource changes and notifies them through webhooks.","title":"Notifications"},{"location":"operator-manual/rbac/","text":"RBAC Configuration \u00b6 The RBAC feature enables restriction of access to Argo CD resources. Argo CD does not have its own user management system and has only one built-in user admin . The admin user is a superuser and it has unrestricted access to the system. RBAC requires SSO configuration or one or more local users setup . Once SSO or local users are configured, additional RBAC roles can be defined, and SSO groups or local users can man be mapped to roles. Basic Built-in Roles \u00b6 Argo CD has two pre-defined roles but RBAC configuration allows defining roles and groups (see below). role:readonly - read-only access to all resources role:admin - unrestricted access to all resources These default built-in role definitions can be seen in builtin-policy.csv RBAC Permission Structure \u00b6 Breaking down the permissions definition differs slightly between applications and every other resource type in Argo CD. All resources except applications permissions (see next bullet): p, <role/user/group>, <resource>, <action>, <object> Applications (which belong to an AppProject): p, <role/user/group>, <resource>, <action>, <appproject>/<object> RBAC Resources and Actions \u00b6 Resources: clusters , projects , applications , repositories , certificates Actions: get , create , update , delete , sync , override , action Tying It All Together \u00b6 Additional roles and groups can be configured in argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap. The example below configures a custom role, named org-admin . The role is assigned to any user which belongs to your-github-org:your-team group. All other users get the default policy of role:readonly , which cannot modify Argo CD settings. ArgoCD ConfigMap argocd-rbac-cm Example: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd-rbac-cm namespace : argocd data : policy.default : role:readonly policy.csv : | p, role:org-admin, applications, *, */*, allow p, role:org-admin, clusters, get, *, allow p, role:org-admin, repositories, get, *, allow p, role:org-admin, repositories, create, *, allow p, role:org-admin, repositories, update, *, allow p, role:org-admin, repositories, delete, *, allow g, your-github-org:your-team, role:org-admin Another policy.csv example might look as follows: p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, create, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, delete, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, get, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, override, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, sync, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, update, staging-db-admins/*, allow p, role:staging-db-admins, projects, get, staging-db-admins, allow g, db-admins, role:staging-db-admins This example defines a role called staging-db-admins with seven permissions that allow that role to perform the actions ( create / delete / get / override / sync / update applications, and get appprojects) against * (all) objects in the staging-db-admins Argo CD AppProject. Anonymous Access \u00b6 The anonymous access to Argo CD can be enabled using users.anonymous.enabled field in argocd-cm (see argocd-cm.yaml ). The anonymous users get default role permissions specified by policy.default in argocd-rbac-cm.yaml . For read-only access you'll want policy.default: role:readonly as above Validating and testing your RBAC policies \u00b6 If you want to ensure that your RBAC policies are working as expected, you can use the argocd-util rbac command to validate them. This tool allows you to test whether a certain role or subject can perform the requested action with a policy that's not live yet in the system, i.e. from a local file or config map. Additionally, it can be used against the live policy in the cluster your Argo CD is running in. To check whether your new policy is valid and understood by Argo CD's RBAC implementation, you can use the argocd-util rbac validate command. Validating a policy \u00b6 To validate a policy stored in a local text file: argocd-util rbac validate --policy-file somepolicy.csv To validate a policy stored in a local K8s ConfigMap definition in a YAML file: argocd-util rbac validate --policy-file argocd-rbac-cm.yaml To validate a policy stored in K8s, used by Argo CD in namespace argocd , ensure that your current context in ~/.kube/config is pointing to your Argo CD cluster and give appropriate namespace: argocd-util rbac validate --namespace argocd Testing a policy \u00b6 To test whether a role or subject (group or local user) has sufficient permissions to execute certain actions on certain resources, you can use the argocd-util rbac can command.

The following are some security topics and implementation details of Argo CD. Authentication \u00b6 Authentication to Argo CD API server is performed exclusively using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Username/password bearer tokens are not used for authentication. The JWT is obtained/managed in one of the following ways: For the local admin user, a username/password is exchanged for a JWT using the /api/v1/session endpoint. This token is signed & issued by the Argo CD API server itself, and has no expiration. When the admin password is updated, all existing admin JWT tokens are immediately revoked. The password is stored as a bcrypt hash in the argocd-secret Secret. For Single Sign-On users, the user completes an OAuth2 login flow to the configured OIDC identity provider (either delegated through the bundled Dex provider, or directly to a self-managed OIDC provider). This JWT is signed & issued by the IDP, and expiration and revocation is handled by the provider. Dex tokens expire after 24 hours. Automation tokens are generated for a project using the /api/v1/projects/{project}/roles/{role}/token endpoint, and are signed & issued by Argo CD. These tokens are limited in scope and privilege, and can only be used to manage application resources in the project which it belongs to. Project JWTs have a configurable expiration and can be immediately revoked by deleting the JWT reference ID from the project role. Authorization \u00b6 Authorization is performed by iterating the list of group membership in a user's JWT groups claims, and comparing each group against the roles/rules in the RBAC policy. Any matched rule permits access to the API request. TLS \u00b6 All network communication is performed over TLS including service-to-service communication between the three components (argocd-server, argocd-repo-server, argocd-application-controller). The Argo CD API server can enforce the use of TLS 1.2 using the flag: --tlsminversion 1.2 . Sensitive Information \u00b6 Secrets \u00b6 Argo CD never returns sensitive data from its API, and redacts all sensitive data in API payloads and logs. This includes: cluster credentials Git credentials OAuth2 client secrets Kubernetes Secret values External Cluster Credentials \u00b6 To manage external clusters, Argo CD stores the credentials of the external cluster as a Kubernetes Secret in the argocd namespace. This secret contains the K8s API bearer token associated with the argocd-manager ServiceAccount created during argocd cluster add , along with connection options to that API server (TLS configuration/certs, aws-iam-authenticator RoleARN, etc...). The information is used to reconstruct a REST config and kubeconfig to the cluster used by Argo CD services. To rotate the bearer token used by Argo CD, the token can be deleted (e.g. using kubectl) which causes kubernetes to generate a new secret with a new bearer token. The new token can be re-inputted to Argo CD by re-running argocd cluster add . Run the following commands against the managed cluster: # run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster kubectl delete secret argocd-manager-token-XXXXXX -n kube-system argocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME To revoke Argo CD's access to a managed cluster, delete the RBAC artifacts against the managed cluster, and remove the cluster entry from Argo CD: # run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster kubectl delete sa argocd-manager -n kube-system kubectl delete clusterrole argocd-manager-role kubectl delete clusterrolebinding argocd-manager-role-binding argocd cluster rm https://your-kubernetes-cluster-addr NOTE: for AWS EKS clusters, aws-iam-authenticator is used to authenticate to the external cluster, which uses IAM roles in lieu of locally stored tokens, so token rotation is not needed, and revocation is handled through IAM. Cluster RBAC \u00b6 By default, Argo CD uses a clusteradmin level role in order to: watch & operate on cluster state deploy resources to the cluster Although Argo CD requires cluster-wide read privileges to resources in the managed cluster to function properly, it does not necessarily need full write privileges to the cluster. The ClusterRole used by argocd-server and argocd-application-controller can be modified such that write privileges are limited to only the namespaces and resources that you wish Argo CD to manage. To fine-tune privileges of externally managed clusters, edit the ClusterRole of the argocd-manager-role # run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-manager-role To fine-tune privileges which Argo CD has against its own cluster (i.e. https://kubernetes.default.svc ), edit the following cluster roles where Argo CD is running in: # run using a kubeconfig to the cluster Argo CD is running in kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-server kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-application-controller Tip If you want to deny ArgoCD access to a kind of resource then add it as an excluded resource . Auditing \u00b6 As a GitOps deployment tool, the Git commit history provides a natural audit log of what changes were made to application configuration, when they were made, and by whom. However, this audit log only applies to what happened in Git and does not necessarily correlate one-to-one with events that happen in a cluster. For example, User A could have made multiple commits to application manifests, but User B could have just only synced those changes to the cluster sometime later. To complement the Git revision history, Argo CD emits Kubernetes Events of application activity, indicating the responsible actor when applicable. For example: $ kubectl get events LAST SEEN FIRST SEEN COUNT NAME KIND SUBOBJECT TYPE REASON SOURCE MESSAGE 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c5edd33aeac Application Normal ResourceCreated argocd-server admin created application 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c5f0f747acf Application Normal ResourceUpdated argocd-application-controller Updated sync status: -> OutOfSync 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c5f0fbebbff Application Normal ResourceUpdated argocd-application-controller Updated health status: -> Missing 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c6069e14f4d Application Normal OperationStarted argocd-server admin initiated sync to HEAD ( 8a1cb4a02d3538e54907c827352f66f20c3d7b0d ) 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c60a55a81a8 Application Normal OperationCompleted argocd-application-controller Sync operation to 8a1cb4a02d3538e54907c827352f66f20c3d7b0d succeeded 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c60af1ccae2 Application Normal ResourceUpdated argocd-application-controller Updated sync status: OutOfSync -> Synced 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c60af5bc4f0 Application Normal ResourceUpdated argocd-application-controller Updated health status: Missing -> Progressing 1m 1m 1 guestbook.157f7c651990e848 Application Normal ResourceUpdated argocd-application-controller Updated health status: Progressing -> Healthy These events can be then be persisted for longer periods of time using other tools as Event Exporter or Event Router .

Settings \u00b6 Argo CD provides multiple ways to customize system behavior and has a lot of settings. It might be dangerous to modify settings on Argo CD used in production by multiple users. Before applying settings you can use argocd-util binary to make sure that settings are valid and Argo CD is working as expected. The argocd-util binary is available in argocd image and might be used using docker. Example: docker run --rm -it -w /src -v $( pwd ) :/src argoproj/argocd:<version> \\ argocd-util settings validate --argocd-cm-path ./argocd-cm.yaml If you are using Linux you can extract argocd-util binary from docker image: docker run --rm -it -w /src -v $( pwd ) :/src argocd cp /usr/local/bin/argocd-util ./argocd-util The argocd-util settings validate command performs basic settings validation and print short summary of each settings group. Diffing Customization Diffing customization allows excluding some resource fields from diffing process. The diffing customizations are configured in resource.customizations field of argocd-cm ConfigMap. The following argocd-util command prints information about fields excluded from diffing in the specified ConfigMap. docker run --rm -it -w /src -v $( pwd ) :/src argoproj/argocd:<version> \\ argocd-util settings resource-overrides ignore-differences ./deploy.yaml --argocd-cm-path ./argocd-cm.yaml Health Assessment Health assessment allows excluding some resource fields from diffing process.

To eliminate this delay from polling, the API server can be configured to receive webhook events. Argo CD supports Git webhook notifications from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server and Gogs. The following explains how to configure a Git webhook for GitHub, but the same process should be applicable to other providers. 1. Create The WebHook In The Git Provider \u00b6 In your Git provider, navigate to the settings page where webhooks can be configured. The payload URL configured in the Git provider should use the /api/webhook endpoint of your Argo CD instance (e.g. [https://argocd.example.com/api/webhook]). If you wish to use a shared secret, input an arbitrary value in the secret. This value will be used when configuring the webhook in the next step. Note When creating the webhook in Github, the \"Content type\" needs to be set to \"application/json\". The default value \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" is not supported by the library used to handle the hooks 2. Configure Argo CD With The WebHook Secret (Optional) \u00b6 Configuring a webhook shared secret is optional, since Argo CD will still refresh applications related to the Git repository, even with unauthenticated webhook events. This is safe to do since the contents of webhook payloads are considered untrusted, and will only result in a refresh of the application (a process which already occurs at three-minute intervals). If Argo CD is publicly accessible, then configuring a webhook secret is recommended to prevent a DDoS attack. In the argocd-secret kubernetes secret, configure one of the following keys with the Git provider's webhook secret configured in step 1.

It is recommended to use admin user only for initial configuration and then switch to local users or configure SSO integration. Local users/accounts (v1.5) \u00b6 The local users/accounts feature serves two main use-cases: Auth tokens for Argo CD management automation. It is possible to configure an API account with limited permissions and generate an authentication token. Such token can be used to automatically create applications, projects etc. Additional users for a very small team where use of SSO integration might be considered an overkill. The local users don't provide advanced features such as groups, login history etc. So if you need such features it is strongly recommended to use SSO. Note When you create local users, each of those users will need additional RBAC rules set up, otherwise they will fall back to the default policy specified by policy.default field of the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap. The maximum length of a local account's username is 32.

The following environments variables are available to control throttling settings: ARGOCD_SESSION_MAX_FAIL_COUNT : Maximum number of failed logins before Argo CD starts rejecting login attempts. Default: 5. ARGOCD_SESSION_FAILURE_WINDOW_SECONDS : Number of seconds for the failure window. Default: 300 (5 minutes). If this is set to 0, the failure window is disabled and the login attempts gets rejected after 10 consecutive logon failures, regardless of the time frame they happened. ARGOCD_SESSION_MAX_CACHE_SIZE : Maximum number of entries allowed in the cache. Default: 1000 ARGOCD_MAX_CONCURRENT_LOGIN_REQUESTS_COUNT : Limits max number of concurrent login requests. If set to 0 then limit is disabled. Default: 50. SSO \u00b6 There are two ways that SSO can be configured: Bundled Dex OIDC provider - use this option if your current provider does not support OIDC (e.g. SAML, LDAP) or if you wish to leverage any of Dex's connector features (e.g. the ability to map GitHub organizations and teams to OIDC groups claims). Existing OIDC provider - use this if you already have an OIDC provider which you are using (e.g. Okta , OneLogin , Auth0 , Microsoft , Keycloak , Google (G Suite) ), where you manage your users, groups, and memberships. Dex \u00b6 Argo CD embeds and bundles Dex as part of its installation, for the purpose of delegating authentication to an external identity provider. Multiple types of identity providers are supported (OIDC, SAML, LDAP, GitHub, etc...). SSO configuration of Argo CD requires editing the argocd-cm ConfigMap with Dex connector settings. This document describes how to configure Argo CD SSO using GitHub (OAuth2) as an example, but the steps should be similar for other identity providers. 1. Register the application in the identity provider \u00b6 In GitHub, register a new application. The callback address should be the /api/dex/callback endpoint of your Argo CD URL (e.g. https://argocd.example.com/api/dex/callback ). After registering the app, you will receive an OAuth2 client ID and secret. These values will be inputted into the Argo CD configmap. 2. Configure Argo CD for SSO \u00b6 Edit the argocd-cm configmap: kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocd In the url key, input the base URL of Argo CD. In this example, it is https://argocd.example.com In the dex.config key, add the github connector to the connectors sub field. See Dex's GitHub connector documentation for explanation of the fields. A minimal config should populate the clientID, clientSecret generated in Step 1. You will very likely want to restrict logins to one or more GitHub organization. In the connectors.config.orgs list, add one or more GitHub organizations. Any member of the org will then be able to login to Argo CD to perform management tasks. data : url : https://argocd.example.com dex.config : | connectors: # GitHub example - type: github id: github name: GitHub config: clientID: aabbccddeeff00112233 clientSecret: $dex.github.clientSecret orgs: - name: your-github-org # GitHub enterprise example - type: github id: acme-github name: Acme GitHub config: hostName: github.acme.com clientID: abcdefghijklmnopqrst clientSecret: $dex.acme.clientSecret orgs: - name: your-github-org After saving, the changes should take affect automatically. NOTES: Any values which start with '$' will look to a key in argocd-secret of the same name (minus the $), to obtain the actual value. This allows you to store the clientSecret as a kubernetes secret. Kubernetes secrets must be base64 encoded. To base64 encode your secret, you can run printf RAW_STRING | base64 . There is no need to set redirectURI in the connectors.config as shown in the dex documentation. Argo CD will automatically use the correct redirectURI for any OAuth2 connectors, to match the correct external callback URL (e.g. https://argocd.example.com/api/dex/callback ) Existing OIDC Provider \u00b6 To configure Argo CD to delegate authenticate to your existing OIDC provider, add the OAuth2 configuration to the argocd-cm ConfigMap under the oidc.config key: data : url : https://argocd.example.com oidc.config : | name: Okta issuer: https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com clientID: aaaabbbbccccddddeee clientSecret: $oidc.okta.clientSecret # Optional set of OIDC scopes to request. If omitted, defaults to: [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\", \"groups\"] requestedScopes: [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\", \"groups\"] # Optional set of OIDC claims to request on the ID token. requestedIDTokenClaims: {\"groups\": {\"essential\": true}} # Some OIDC providers require a separate clientID for different callback URLs. # For example, if configuring Argo CD with self-hosted Dex, you will need a separate client ID # for the 'localhost' (CLI) client to Dex. This field is optional. If omitted, the CLI will # use the same clientID as the Argo CD server cliClientID: vvvvwwwwxxxxyyyyzzzz Note The callback address should be the /auth/callback endpoint of your Argo CD URL (e.g. https://argocd.example.com/auth/callback). Requesting additional ID token claims \u00b6 Not all OIDC providers support a special groups scope. E.g. Okta, OneLogin and Microsoft do support a special groups scope and will return group membership with the default requestedScopes . Other OIDC providers might be able to return a claim with group membership if explicitly requested to do so. Individual claims can be requested with requestedIDTokenClaims , see OpenID Connect Claims Parameter for details. The Argo CD configuration for claims is as follows: oidc.config : | requestedIDTokenClaims: email: essential: true groups: essential: true value: org:myorg acr: essential: true values: - urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver - urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze For a simple case this can be: oidc.config : | requestedIDTokenClaims: {\"groups\": {\"essential\": true}} Configuring a custom logout URL for your OIDC provider \u00b6 Optionally, if your OIDC provider exposes a logout API and you wish to configure a custom logout URL for the purposes of invalidating any active session post logout, you can do so by specifying it as follows: oidc.config : | name: example-OIDC-provider issuer: https://example-OIDC-provider.com clientID: xxxxxxxxx clientSecret: xxxxxxxxx requestedScopes: [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\", \"groups\"] requestedIDTokenClaims: {\"groups\": {\"essential\": true}} logoutURL: https://example-OIDC-provider.com/logout?id_token_hint={{token}} By default, this would take the user to their OIDC provider's login page after logout. If you also wish to redirect the user back to Argo CD after logout, you can specify the logout URL as follows: ... logoutURL : https://example-OIDC-provider.com/logout?id_token_hint={{token}}&post_logout_redirect_uri={{logoutRedirectURL}} You are not required to specify a logoutRedirectURL as this is automatically generated by ArgoCD as your base ArgoCD url + Rootpath Note The post logout redirect URI may need to be whitelisted against your OIDC provider's client settings for ArgoCD.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"operator-manual/user-management/#overview","text":"Once installed Argo CD has one built-in admin user that has full access to the system.

Please contribute! If you're using this IdP please consider contributing to this document. Integrating OneLogin and ArgoCD \u00b6 These instructions will take you through the entire process of getting your ArgoCD application authenticating with OneLogin. You will create a custom OIDC application within OneLogin and configure ArgoCD to use OneLogin for authentication, using UserRoles set in OneLogin to determine privileges in Argo. Creating and Configuring OneLogin App \u00b6 For your ArgoCD application to communicate with OneLogin, you will first need to create and configure the OIDC application on the OneLogin side. Create OIDC Application \u00b6 To create the application, do the following: Navigate to your OneLogin portal, then Administration > Applications. Click \"Add App\". Search for \"OpenID Connect\" in the search field. Select the \"OpenId Connect (OIDC)\" app to create. Update the \"Display Name\" field (could be something like \"ArgoCD (Production)\". Click \"Save\". Configuring OIDC Application Settings \u00b6 Now that the application is created, you can configure the settings of the app. Configuration Tab \u00b6 Update the \"Configuration\" settings as follows: Select the \"Configuration\" tab on the left. Set the \"Login Url\" field to https://argocd.myproject.com/auth/login, replacing the hostname with your own. Set the \"Redirect Url\" field to https://argocd.myproject.com/auth/callback, replacing the hostname with your own. Click \"Save\". OneLogin may not let you save any other fields until the above fields are set. Info Tab \u00b6 You can update the \"Display Name\", \"Description\", \"Notes\", or the display images that appear in the OneLogin portal here. Parameters Tab \u00b6 This tab controls what information is sent to Argo in the token. By default it will contain a Groups field and \"Credentials are\" is set to \"Configured by admin\". Leave \"Credentials are\" as the default. How the Value of the Groups field is configured will vary based on your needs, but to use OneLogin User roles for ArgoCD privileges, configure the Value of the Groups field with the following: Click \"Groups\". A modal appears. Set the \"Default if no value selected\" field to \"User Roles\". Set the transform field (below it) to \"Semicolon Delimited Input\". Click \"Save\". When a user attempts to login to Argo with OneLogin, the User roles in OneLogin, say, Manager, ProductTeam, and TestEngineering, will be included in the Groups field in the token. These are the values needed for Argo to assign permissions. The groups field in the token will look similar to the following: \"groups\": [ \"Manager\", \"ProductTeam\", \"TestEngineering\", ], Rules Tab \u00b6 To get up and running, you do not need to make modifications to any settings here. SSO Tab \u00b6 This tab contains much of the information needed to be placed into your ArgoCD configuration file (API endpoints, client ID, client secret). Confirm \"Application Type\" is set to \"Web\". Confirm \"Token Endpoint\" is set to \"Basic\". Access Tab \u00b6 This tab controls who can see this application in the OneLogin portal. Select the roles you wish to have access to this application and click \"Save\". Users Tab \u00b6 This tab shows you the individual users that have access to this application (usually the ones that have roles specified in the Access Tab). To get up and running, you do not need to make modifications to any settings here. Privileges Tab \u00b6 This tab shows which OneLogin users can configure this app. To get up and running, you do not need to make modifications to any settings here. Updating OIDC configuration in ArgoCD \u00b6 Now that the OIDC application is configured in OneLogin, you can update Argo configuration to communicate with OneLogin, as well as control permissions for those users that authenticate via OneLogin. Tell Argo where OneLogin is \u00b6 Argo needs to have its config map (argocd-cm) updated in order to communicate with OneLogin. Consider the following yaml: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd - cm data : url : https ://< argocd . myproject . com > oidc . config : | name : OneLogin issuer : https :// openid - connect . onelogin . com / oidc clientID : aaaaaaaa - aaaa - aaaa - aaaa - aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa clientSecret : abcdef123456 # Optional set of OIDC scopes to request . If omitted , defaults to : [ \"openid\" , \"profile\" , \"email\" , \"groups\" ] requestedScopes : [ \"openid\" , \"profile\" , \"email\" , \"groups\" ] The \"url\" key should have a value of the hostname of your Argo project. The \"clientID\" is taken from the SSO tab of the OneLogin application. The \u201cissuer\u201d is taken from the SSO tab of the OneLogin application. It is one of the issuer api endpoints. The \"clientSecret\" value is a client secret located in the SSO tab of the OneLogin application. If you get an invalid_client error when trying the authenticate with OneLogin, there is a possibility that your client secret is not proper. Keep in mind that in previous versions clientSecret value had to be base64 encrypted, but it is not required anymore. Configure Permissions for OneLogin Auth'd Users \u00b6 Permissions in ArgoCD can be configured by using the OneLogin role names that are passed in the Groups field in the token. Consider the following yaml in argocd-rbac-cm.yaml: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argocd - rbac - cm namespace : argocd data : policy . default : role : readonly policy . csv : | p , role : org - admin , applications , *, */*, allow p , role : org - admin , clusters , get , *, allow p , role : org - admin , repositories , get , *, allow p , role : org - admin , repositories , create , *, allow p , role : org - admin , repositories , update , *, allow p , role : org - admin , repositories , delete , *, allow g , TestEngineering , role : org - admin In OneLogin, a user with user role \"TestEngineering\" will receive ArgoCD admin privileges when they log in to Argo via OneLogin. All other users will receive the readonly role. The key takeaway here is that \"TestEngineering\" is passed via the Group field in the token (which is specified in the Parameters tab in OneLogin).","title":"OneLogin"},{"location":"operator-manual/user-management/onelogin/#onelogin","text":"Are you using this?

Source Code Repositories \u00b6 Using a separate Git repository to hold your kubernetes manifests, keeping the config separate from your application source code, is highly recommended for the following reasons: It provides a clean separation of application code vs. application config. There will be times when you wish to modify just the manifests without triggering an entire CI build. For example, you likely do not want to trigger a build if you simply wish to bump the number of replicas in a Deployment spec. Cleaner audit log. For auditing purposes, a repo which only holds configuration will have a much cleaner Git history of what changes were made, without the noise coming from check-ins due to normal development activity. Your application may be comprised of services built from multiple Git repositories, but is deployed as a single unit. Oftentimes, microservices applications are comprised of services with different versioning schemes, and release cycles (e.g. ELK, Kafka + Zookeeper). It may not make sense to store the manifests in one of the source code repositories of a single component. Separation of access. The developers who are developing the application, may not necessarily be the same people who can/should push to production environments, either intentionally or unintentionally. By having separate repos, commit access can be given to the source code repo, and not the application config repo. If you are automating your CI pipeline, pushing manifest changes to the same Git repository can trigger an infinite loop of build jobs and Git commit triggers. Having a separate repo to push config changes to, prevents this from happening. Leaving Room For Imperativeness \u00b6 It may be desired to leave room for some imperativeness/automation, and not have everything defined in your Git manifests. For example, if you want the number of your deployment's replicas to be managed by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler , then you would not want to track replicas in Git. apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : nginx-deployment spec : # do not include replicas in the manifests if you want replicas to be controlled by HPA # replicas: 1 template : spec : containers : - image : nginx:1.7.9 name : nginx ports : - containerPort : 80 ... Ensuring Manifests At Git Revisions Are Truly Immutable \u00b6 When using templating tools like helm or kustomize , it is possible for manifests to change their meaning from one day to the next. This is typically caused by changes made to an upstream helm repository or kustomize base. For example, consider the following kustomization.yaml bases : - github.com/argoproj/argo-cd//manifests/cluster-install The above kustomization has a remote base to the HEAD revision of the argo-cd repo. Since this is not a stable target, the manifests for this kustomize application can suddenly change meaning, even without any changes to your own Git repository. A better version would be to use a Git tag or commit SHA.

Signature verification is configured on project level. If a project is configured to enforce signature verification, all applications associated with this project must have the commits in the source repositories signed with a GnuPG public key known to ArgoCD. ArgoCD will refuse to sync to any revision that does not have a valid signature made by one of the configured keys. The controller will emit a ResourceComparison error if it tries to sync to a revision that is either not signed, or is signed by an unknown or not allowed public key. By default, signature verification is enabled but not enforced. If you wish to completely disable the GnuPG functionality in ArgoCD, you have to set the environment variable ARGOCD_GPG_ENABLED to \"false\" in the pod templates of the argocd-server , argocd-repo-server and argocd-application-controller deployment manifests. Verification of GnuPG signatures is only supported with Git repositories. It is not possible using Helm repositories. A few words about trust ArgoCD uses a very simple trust model for the keys you import: Once the key is imported, ArgoCD will trust it. ArgoCD does not support more complex trust models, and it is not necessary (nor possible) to sign the public keys you are going to import into ArgoCD. Signature verification targets \u00b6 If signature verification is enforced, ArgoCD will verify the signature using following strategy: If target revision is a pointer to a commit object (i.e. a branch name, the name of a reference such as HEAD or a commit SHA), ArgoCD will perform the signature verification on the commit object the name points to, i.e. a commit. If target revision resolves to a tag and the tag is a lightweight tag, the behaviour is same as if target revision would be a pointer to a commit object. However, if the tag is annotated, the target revision will point to a tag object and thus, the signature verification is performed on the tag object, i.e. the tag itself must be signed (using git tag -s ). Enforcing signature verification \u00b6 To configure enforcing of signature verification, the following steps must be performed: Import the GnuPG public key(s) used for signing commits in ArgoCD Configure a project to enforce signature verification for given keys Once you have configured one or more keys to be required for verification for a given project, enforcement is active for all applications associated with this project. Warning If signature verification is enforced, you will not be able to sync from local sources (i.e. argocd app sync --local ) anymore. Importing GnuPG public keys \u00b6 You can configure the GnuPG public keys that ArgoCD will use for verification of commit signatures using either the CLI, the web UI or configuring it using declarative setup. Note After you have imported a GnuPG key, it may take a while until the key is propagated within the cluster, even if listed as configured. If you still cannot sync to commits signed by the already imported key, please see the troubleshooting section below. Users wanting to manage the GnuPG public key configuration require the RBAC permissions for gpgkeys resources. Manage public keys using the CLI \u00b6 To configure GnuPG public keys using the CLI, use the argocd gpg command. Listing all configured keys \u00b6 To list all configured keys known to ArgoCD, use the argocd gpg list sub-command: argocd gpg list Show information about a certain key \u00b6 To get information about a specific key, use the argocd gpg get sub-command: argocd gpg get <key-id> Importing a key \u00b6 To import a new key to ArgoCD, use the argocd gpg add sub-command: argocd gpg add --from <path-to-key> The key to be imported can be either in binary or ASCII-armored format. Removing a key from configuration \u00b6 To remove a previously configured key from the configuration, use the argocd gpg rm sub-command: argocd gpg rm <key-id> Manage public keys using the Web UI \u00b6 Basic key management functionality for listing, importing and removing GnuPG public keys is implemented in the Web UI. You can find the configuration module from the Settings page in the GnuPG keys module. Please note that when you configure keys using the Web UI, the key must be imported in ASCII armored format for now. Manage public keys in declarative setup \u00b6 ArgoCD stores public keys internally in the argocd-gpg-keys-cm ConfigMap resource, with the public GnuPG key's ID as its name and the ASCII armored key data as string value, i.e. the entry for the GitHub's web-flow signing key would look like follows: 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 : | -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- mQENBFmUaEEBCACzXTDt6ZnyaVtueZASBzgnAmK13q9Urgch+sKYeIhdymjuMQta x15OklctmrZtqre5kwPUosG3/B2/ikuPYElcHgGPL4uL5Em6S5C/oozfkYzhwRrT SQzvYjsE4I34To4UdE9KA97wrQjGoz2Bx72WDLyWwctD3DKQtYeHXswXXtXwKfjQ 7Fy4+Bf5IPh76dA8NJ6UtjjLIDlKqdxLW4atHe6xWFaJ+XdLUtsAroZcXBeWDCPa buXCDscJcLJRKZVc62gOZXXtPfoHqvUPp3nuLA4YjH9bphbrMWMf810Wxz9JTd3v yWgGqNY0zbBqeZoGv+TuExlRHT8ASGFS9SVDABEBAAG0NUdpdEh1YiAod2ViLWZs b3cgY29tbWl0IHNpZ25pbmcpIDxub3JlcGx5QGdpdGh1Yi5jb20+iQEiBBMBCAAW BQJZlGhBCRBK7hj4Ov3rIwIbAwIZAQAAmQEH/iATWFmi2oxlBh3wAsySNCNV4IPf DDMeh6j80WT7cgoX7V7xqJOxrfrqPEthQ3hgHIm7b5MPQlUr2q+UPL22t/I+ESF6 9b0QWLFSMJbMSk+BXkvSjH9q8jAO0986/pShPV5DU2sMxnx4LfLfHNhTzjXKokws +8ptJ8uhMNIDXfXuzkZHIxoXk3rNcjDN5c5X+sK8UBRH092BIJWCOfaQt7v7wig5 4Ra28pM9GbHKXVNxmdLpCFyzvyMuCmINYYADsC848QQFFwnd4EQnupo6QvhEVx1O j7wDwvuH5dCrLuLwtwXaQh0onG4583p0LGms2Mf5F+Ick6o/4peOlBoZz48= =Bvzs -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Configuring a project to enforce signature verification \u00b6 Once you have imported the GnuPG keys to ArgoCD, you must now configure the project to enforce the verification of commit signatures with the imported keys. Configuring using the CLI \u00b6 Adding a key ID to list of allowed keys \u00b6 To add a key ID to the list of allowed GnuPG keys for a project, you can use the argocd proj add-signature-key command, i.e. the following command would add the key ID 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 to the project named myproj : argocd proj add-signature-key myproj 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 Removing a key ID from the list of allowed keys \u00b6 Similarily, you can remove a key ID from the list of allowed GnuPG keys for a project using the argocd proj remove-signature-key command, i.e. to remove the key added above from project myproj , use the command: argocd proj remove-signature-key myproj 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 Showing allowed key IDs for a project \u00b6 To see which key IDs are allowed for a given project, you can inspect the output of the argocd proj get command, i.e for a project named gpg : $ argocd proj get gpg Name: gpg Description: GnuPG verification Destinations: *,* Repositories: * Allowed Cluster Resources: */* Denied Namespaced Resources: <none> Signature keys: 4AEE18F83AFDEB23, 07E34825A909B250 Orphaned Resources: disabled Override list of key IDs \u00b6 You can also explicitly set the currently allowed keys with one or more new keys using the argocd proj set command in combination with the --signature-keys flag, which you can use to specify a comma separated list of allowed key IDs: argocd proj set myproj --signature-keys 4AEE18F83AFDEB23,07E34825A909B250 The --signature-keys flag can also be used on project creation, i.e. the argocd proj create command. Configure using the Web UI \u00b6 You can configure the GnuPG key IDs required for signature verification using the web UI, in the Project configuration. Navigate to the Settings page and select the Projects module, then click on the project you want to configure. From the project's details page, click Edit and find the Required signature keys section, where you can add or remove the key IDs for signature verification. After you have modified your project, click Update to save the changes. Configure using declarative setup \u00b6 You can specify the key IDs required for signature verification in the project manifest within the signatureKeys section, i.e: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AppProject metadata : name : gpg namespace : argocd spec : clusterResourceWhitelist : - group : '*' kind : '*' description : GnuPG verification destinations : - namespace : '*' server : '*' namespaceResourceWhitelist : - group : '*' kind : '*' signatureKeys : - keyID : 4AEE18F83AFDEB23 sourceRepos : - '*' signatureKeys is an array of SignatureKey objects, whose only property is keyID at the moment. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Disabling the feature \u00b6 The GnuPG feature can be completely disabled if desired. In order to disable it, set the environment variable ARGOCD_GPG_ENABLED to false for the pod templates of the argocd-server , argocd-repo-server and argocd-application-controller deployments. After the pods have been restarted, the GnuPG feature is disabled. GnuPG key ring \u00b6 The GnuPG key ring used for signature verification is maintained within the pods of argocd-repo-server . The keys in the keyring are synchronized to the configuration stored in the argocd-gpg-keys-cm ConfigMap resource, which is volume-mounted to the argocd-repo-server pods. Note The GnuPG key ring in the pods is transient and gets recreated from the configuration on each restart of the pods. You should never add or remove keys manually to the key ring, because your changes will be lost. Also, any of the private keys found in the key ring are transient and will be regenerated upon each restart. The private key is only used to build the trust DB for the running pod. To check whether the keys are actually in sync, you can kubectl exec into the repository server's pods and inspect the key ring, which is located at path /app/config/gpg/keys $ kubectl exec -it argocd-repo-server-7d6bdfdf6d-hzqkg bash argocd@argocd-repo-server-7d6bdfdf6d-hzqkg:~$ GNUPGHOME = /app/config/gpg/keys gpg --list-keys /app/config/gpg/keys/pubring.kbx -------------------------------- pub rsa2048 2020 -06-15 [ SC ] [ expires: 2020 -12-12 ] D48F075D818A813C436914BC9324F0D2144753B1 uid [ ultimate ] Anon Ymous ( ArgoCD key signing key ) <noreply@argoproj.io> pub rsa2048 2017 -08-16 [ SC ] 5DE3E0509C47EA3CF04A42D34AEE18F83AFDEB23 uid [ ultimate ] GitHub ( web-flow commit signing ) <noreply@github.com> argocd@argocd-repo-server-7d6bdfdf6d-hzqkg:~$ If the key ring stays out of sync with your configuration after you have added or removed keys for a longer period of time, you might want to restart your argocd-repo-server pods.

Alternate or multiple values file(s), can be specified using the --values flag. The flag can be repeated to support multiple values files: argocd app set helm-guestbook --values values-production.yaml Note Values files must be in the same git repository as the Helm chart. The files can be in a different location in which case it can be accessed using a relative path relative to the root directory of the Helm chart. Helm Parameters \u00b6 Helm has the ability to set parameter values, which override any values in a values.yaml . For example, service.type is a common parameter which is exposed in a Helm chart: helm template . --set service.type = LoadBalancer Similarly, Argo CD can override values in the values.yaml parameters using argo app set command, in the form of -p PARAM=VALUE . For example: argocd app set helm-guestbook -p service.type = LoadBalancer Helm Release Name \u00b6 By default, the Helm release name is equal to the Application name to which it belongs. Sometimes, especially on a centralised ArgoCD, you may want to override that name, and it is possible with the release-name flag on the cli: argocd app set helm-guestbook --release-name myRelease or using the releaseName for yaml: source : helm : releaseName : myRelease Important notice on overriding the release name Please note that overriding the Helm release name might cause problems when the chart you are deploying is using the app.kubernetes.io/instance label. ArgoCD injects this label with the value of the Application name for tracking purposes. So when overriding the release name, the Application name will stop being equal to the release name. Because ArgoCD will overwrite the label with the Application name it might cause some selectors on the resources to stop working. In order to avoid this we can configure ArgoCD to use another label for tracking in the ArgoCD configmap argocd-cm.yaml - check the lines describing application.instanceLabelKey . Helm Hooks \u00b6 v1.3 or later Helm hooks are similar to Argo CD hooks . In Helm, a hook is any normal Kubernetes resource annotated with the helm.sh/hook annotation. Argo CD supports many (most?) Helm hooks by mapping the Helm annotations onto Argo CD's own hook annotations: Helm Annotation Notes helm.sh/hook: crd-install Supported as equivalent to argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync . helm.sh/hook: pre-delete Not supported.

'install' vs 'upgrade' vs 'sync' Argo CD cannot know if it is running a first-time \"install\" or an \"upgrade\" - every operation is a \"sync'. This means that, by default, apps that have pre-install and pre-upgrade will have those hooks run at the same time. Hook Tips \u00b6 Make your hook idempotent. Annotate crd-install with hook-weight: \"-2\" to make sure it runs to success before any install or upgrade hooks. Annotate pre-install and post-install with hook-weight: \"-1\" . This will make sure it runs to success before any upgrade hooks. Annotate pre-upgrade and post-upgrade with hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation to make sure it runs on every sync. Read more about Argo hooks and Helm hooks . Random Data \u00b6 Helm templating has the ability to generate random data during chart rendering via the randAlphaNum function. Many helm charts from the charts repository make use of this feature. For example, the following is the secret for the redis helm chart : data : {{ - if .Values.password }} redis-password : {{ .Values.password | b64enc | quote }} {{ - else }} redis-password : {{ randAlphaNum 10 | b64enc | quote }} {{ - end }} The Argo CD application controller periodically compares Git state against the live state, running the helm template <CHART> command to generate the helm manifests. Because the random value is regenerated every time the comparison is made, any application which makes use of the randAlphaNum function will always be in an OutOfSync state. This can be mitigated by explicitly setting a value, in the values.yaml such that the value is stable between each comparison. For example: argocd app set redis -p password = abc123 Build Environment \u00b6 v1.4 Helm apps have access to the standard build environment via substitution as parameters. E.g. via the CLI: argocd app create APPNAME \\ --helm-set-string 'app=${ARGOCD_APP_NAME}' Or via declarative syntax: spec : source : helm : parameters : - name : app value : $ARGOCD_APP_NAME Helm plugins \u00b6 v1.5 Argo CD is un-opinionated on what cloud provider you use and what kind of Helm plugins you are using, that's why there are no plugins delivered with the ArgoCD image.

One of the cases is that you would like to use Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 storage to save the Helm charts, for example: https://github.com/hayorov/helm-gcs where you can use gs:// protocol for Helm chart repository access. In order to do that you have to prepare your own ArgoCD image with installed plugins.

This provides flexibility in having most of the application manifests defined in Git, while leaving room for some parts of the k8s manifests determined dynamically, or outside of Git. It also serves as an alternative way of redeploying an application by changing application parameters via Argo CD, instead of making the changes to the manifests in Git. Tip Many consider this mode of operation as an anti-pattern to GitOps, since the source of truth becomes a union of the Git repository, and the application overrides. The Argo CD parameter overrides feature is provided mainly as a convenience to developers and is intended to be used in dev/test environments, vs. production environments. To use parameter overrides, run the argocd app set -p (COMPONENT=)PARAM=VALUE command: argocd app set guestbook -p image = example/guestbook:abcd123 argocd app sync guestbook The PARAM is expected to be a normal YAML path argocd app set guestbook -p ingress.enabled = true argocd app set guestbook -p ingress.hosts [ 0 ]= guestbook.myclusterurl The argocd app set command supports more tool-specific flags such as --kustomize-image , --jsonnet-ext-var-str etc flags. You can also specify overrides directly in the source field on application spec. Read more about supported options in corresponded tool documentation . When To Use Overrides? \u00b6 The following are situations where parameter overrides would be useful: A team maintains a \"dev\" environment, which needs to be continually updated with the latest version of their guestbook application after every build in the tip of master. To address this use case, the application would expose a parameter named image , whose value used in the dev environment contains a placeholder value (e.g. example/guestbook:replaceme ). The placeholder value would be determined externally (outside of Git) such as a build system. Then, as part of the build pipeline, the parameter value of the image would be continually updated to the freshly built image (e.g. argocd app set guestbook -p image=example/guestbook:abcd123 ). A sync operation would result in the application being redeployed with the new image. A repository of Helm manifests is already publicly available (e.g. https://github.com/helm/charts). Since commit access to the repository is unavailable, it is useful to be able to install charts from the public repository and customize the deployment with different parameters, without resorting to forking the repository to make the changes. For example, to install Redis from the Helm chart repository and customize the the database password, you would run: argocd app create redis --repo https://github.com/helm/charts.git --path stable/redis --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default -p password = abc123 Store Overrides In Git \u00b6 The config management tool specific overrides can be specified in .argocd-source.yaml file stored in the source application directory in the Git repository.

This provides flexibility in having most of the application manifests defined in Git, while leaving room for some parts of the k8s manifests determined dynamically, or outside of Git. It also serves as an alternative way of redeploying an application by changing application parameters via Argo CD, instead of making the changes to the manifests in Git. Tip Many consider this mode of operation as an anti-pattern to GitOps, since the source of truth becomes a union of the Git repository, and the application overrides. The Argo CD parameter overrides feature is provided mainly as a convenience to developers and is intended to be used in dev/test environments, vs. production environments. To use parameter overrides, run the argocd app set -p (COMPONENT=)PARAM=VALUE command: argocd app set guestbook -p image = example/guestbook:abcd123 argocd app sync guestbook The PARAM is expected to be a normal YAML path argocd app set guestbook -p ingress.enabled = true argocd app set guestbook -p ingress.hosts [ 0 ]= guestbook.myclusterurl The argocd app set command supports more tool-specific flags such as --kustomize-image , --jsonnet-ext-var-str etc flags.

To address this use case, the application would expose a parameter named image , whose value used in the dev environment contains a placeholder value (e.g. example/guestbook:replaceme ). The placeholder value would be determined externally (outside of Git) such as a build system. Then, as part of the build pipeline, the parameter value of the image would be continually updated to the freshly built image (e.g. argocd app set guestbook -p image=example/guestbook:abcd123 ). A sync operation would result in the application being redeployed with the new image. A repository of Helm manifests is already publicly available (e.g. https://github.com/helm/charts).

ArgoCD will not follow these redirects, so you have to adapt your repository URL to be suffixed with .git . Credentials \u00b6 If application manifests are located in private repository then repository credentials have to be configured. Argo CD supports both HTTP and SSH Git credentials. HTTPS Username And Password Credential \u00b6 Private repositories that require a username and password typically have a URL that start with https:// rather than git@ or ssh:// . Credentials can be configured using Argo CD CLI: argocd repo add https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps --username <username> --password <password> or UI: v1.2 or later Navigate to Settings/Repositories Click Connect Repo using HTTPS button and enter credentials Note: username in screenshot is for illustration purposes only , we have no relationship to this GitHub account should it exist. Click Connect to test the connection and have the repository added earlier than v1.2 Navigate to Settings/Repositories Click Connect Repo button and enter HTTP credentials Access Token \u00b6 Instead of using username and password you might use access token. Following instructions of your Git hosting service to generate the token: Github Gitlab Bitbucket Then, connect the repository using any non-empty string as username and the access token value as a password. Note For some services, you might have to specify your account name as the username instead of any string. TLS Client Certificates for HTTPS repositories \u00b6 v1.2 and later If your repository server requires you to use TLS client certificates for authentication, you can configure ArgoCD repositories to make use of them. For this purpose, --tls-client-cert-path and --tls-client-cert-key-path switches to the argocd repo add command can be used to specify the files on your local system containing client certificate and the corresponding key, respectively: argocd repo add https://repo.example.com/repo.git --tls-client-cert-path ~/mycert.crt --tls-client-cert-key-path ~/mycert.key Of course, you can also use this in combination with the --username and --password switches, if your repository server should require this. The options --tls-client-cert-path and --tls-client-cert-key-path must always be specified together. Your TLS client certificate and corresponding key can also be configured using the UI, see instructions for adding Git repos using HTTPS. Note Your client certificate and key data must be in PEM format, other formats (such as PKCS12) are not understood. Also make sure that your certificate's key is not password protected, otherwise it cannot be used by ArgoCD. Note When pasting TLS client certificate and key in the text areas in the web UI, make sure they contain no unintended line breaks or additional characters. SSH Private Key Credential \u00b6 Private repositories that require an SSH private key have a URL that typically start with git@ or ssh:// rather than https:// . v1.2 or later You can configure your Git repository using HTTPS either using the CLI or the UI. Using the CLI: argocd repo add git@github.com:argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git --ssh-private-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa Using the UI: Navigate to Settings/Repositories Click Connect Repo using SSH button, enter the URL and paste the SSH private key Click Connect to test the connection and have the repository added Note When pasting SSH private key in the UI, make sure there are no unintended line breaks or additional characters in the text area Note When your SSH repository is served from a non-standard port, you have to use ssh:// -style URLs to specify your repository. The scp-style git@yourgit.com:yourrepo URLs do not support port specification, and will treat any port number as part of the repository's path. earlier than v1.2 The Argo CD UI don't support configuring SSH credentials. The SSH credentials can only be configured using the Argo CD CLI: argocd repo add git@github.com:argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git --ssh-private-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa Credential templates \u00b6 previous to v1.4 Credential templates are available only via declarative setup, see Repository credentials in Operator Manual. v1.4 and later You can also set up credentials to serve as templates for connecting repositories, without having to repeat credential configuration. For example, if you setup credential templates for the URL prefix https://github.com/argoproj , these credentials will be used for all repositories with this URL as prefix (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps ) that do not have their own credentials configured. To set up a credential template using the Web UI, simply fill in all relevant credential information in the Connect repo using SSH or Connect repo using HTTPS dialogues (as described above), but select Save as credential template instead of Connect to save the credential template. Be sure to only enter the prefix URL (i.e. https://github.com/argoproj ) instead of the complete repository URL (i.e. https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps ) in the field Repository URL To manage credential templates using the CLI, use the repocreds sub-command, for example argocd repocreds add https://github.com/argoproj --username youruser --password yourpass would setup a credential template for the URL prefix https://github.com/argoproj using the specified username/password combination. Similar to the repo sub-command, you can also list and remove repository credentials using the argocd repocreds list and argocd repocreds rm commands, respectively. In order for ArgoCD to use a credential template for any given repository, the following conditions must be met: The repository must either not be configured at all, or if configured, must not contain any credential information The URL configured for a credential template (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj ) must match as prefix for the repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps ). Note Repositories that require authentication can be added using CLI or Web UI without specifying credentials only after a matching repository credential has been set up Note Matching credential template URL prefixes is done on a best match effort, so the longest (best) match will take precedence. The order of definition is not important, as opposed to pre v1.4 configuration. The following is an example CLI session, depicting repository credential set-up: # Try to add a private repository without specifying credentials, will fail $ argocd repo add https://docker-build/repos/argocd-example-apps FATA [ 0000 ] rpc error: code = Unknown desc = authentication required # Setup a credential template for all repos under https://docker-build/repos $ argocd repocreds add https://docker-build/repos --username test --password test repository credentials for 'https://docker-build/repos' added # Repeat first step, add repo without specifying credentials # URL for template matches, will succeed $ argocd repo add https://docker-build/repos/argocd-example-apps repository 'https://docker-build/repos/argocd-example-apps' added # Add another repo under https://docker-build/repos, specifying invalid creds # Will fail, because it will not use the template (has own creds) $ argocd repo add https://docker-build/repos/example-apps-part-two --username test --password invalid FATA [ 0000 ] rpc error: code = Unknown desc = authentication required Self-signed & Untrusted TLS Certificates \u00b6 v1.2 or later If you are connecting a repository on a HTTPS server using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA) which are not known to ArgoCD, the repository will not be added due to security reasons. This is indicated by an error message such as x509: certificate signed by unknown authority . You can let ArgoCD connect the repository in an insecure way, without verifying the server's certificate at all. This can be accomplished by using the --insecure-skip-server-verification flag when adding the repository with the argocd CLI utility. However, this should be done only for non-production setups, as it imposes a serious security issue through possible man-in-the-middle attacks. You can configure ArgoCD to use a custom certificate for the verification of the server's certificate using the cert add-tls command of the argocd CLI utility. This is the recommended method and suitable for production use. In order to do so, you will need the server's certificate, or the certificate of the CA used to sign the server's certificate, in PEM format. Note For invalid server certificates, such as those without matching server name, or those that are expired, adding a CA certificate will not help. In this case, your only option will be to use the --insecure-skip-server-verification flag to connect the repository. You are strongly urged to use a valid certificate on the repository server, or to urge the server's administrator to replace the faulty certificate with a valid one. Note TLS certificates are configured on a per-server, not on a per-repository basis. If you connect multiple repositories from the same server, you only have to configure the certificates once for this server. Note It can take up to a couple of minutes until the changes performed by the argocd cert command are propagated across your cluster, depending on your Kubernetes setup. Managing TLS certificates using the CLI \u00b6 You can list all configured TLS certificates by using the argocd cert list command using the --cert-type https modifier: $ argocd cert list --cert-type https HOSTNAME TYPE SUBTYPE FINGERPRINT/SUBJECT docker-build https rsa CN = ArgoCD Test CA localhost https rsa CN = localhost Example for adding a HTTPS repository to ArgoCD without verifying the server's certificate ( Caution: This is not recommended for production use): argocd repo add --insecure-skip-server-verification https://git.example.com/test-repo Example for adding a CA certificate contained in file ~/myca-cert.pem to properly verify the repository server: argocd cert add-tls git.example.com --from ~/myca-cert.pem argocd repo add https://git.example.com/test-repo You can also add more than one PEM for a server by concatenating them into the input stream. This might be useful if the repository server is about to replace the server certificate, possibly with one signed by a different CA. This way, you can have the old (current) as well as the new (future) certificate co-existing. If you already have the old certificate configured, use the --upsert flag and add the old and the new one in a single run: cat cert1.pem cert2.pem | argocd cert add-tls git.example.com --upsert Note To replace an existing certificate for a server, use the --upsert flag to the cert add-tls CLI command. Finally, TLS certificates can be removed using the argocd cert rm command with the --cert-type https modifier: argocd cert rm --cert-type https localhost Managing TLS certificates using the ArgoCD web UI \u00b6 It is possible to add and remove TLS certificates using the ArgoCD web UI: In the navigation pane to the left, click on \"Settings\" and choose \"Certificates\" from the settings menu The following page lists all currently configured certificates and provides you with the option to add either a new TLS certificate or SSH known entries: Click on \"Add TLS certificate\", fill in relevant data and click on \"Create\". Take care to specify only the FQDN of your repository server (not the URL) and that you C&P the complete PEM of your TLS certificate into the text area field, including the ----BEGIN CERTIFICATE---- and ----END CERTIFICATE---- lines: To remove a certificate, click on the small three-dotted button next to the certificate entry, select \"Remove\" from the pop-up menu and confirm the removal in the following dialogue. Managing TLS certificates using declarative configuration \u00b6 You can also manage TLS certificates in a declarative, self-managed ArgoCD setup. All TLS certificates are stored in the ConfigMap object argocd-tls-cert-cm . Please refer to the Operator Manual for more information. Before v1.2 We do not currently have first-class support for this. See #1513 . As a work-around, you can customize your Argo CD image. See #1344 Unknown SSH Hosts \u00b6 If you are using a privately hosted Git service over SSH, then you have the following options: v1.2 or later You can let ArgoCD connect the repository in an insecure way, without verifying the server's SSH host key at all. This can be accomplished by using the --insecure-skip-server-verification flag when adding the repository with the argocd CLI utility. However, this should be done only for non-production setups, as it imposes a serious security issue through possible man-in-the-middle attacks. You can make the server's SSH public key known to ArgoCD by using the cert add-ssh command of the argocd CLI utility. This is the recommended method and suitable for production use. In order to do so, you will need the server's SSH public host key, in the known_hosts format understood by ssh . You can get the server's public SSH host key e.g. by using the ssh-keyscan utility. Note It can take up to a couple of minutes until the changes performed by the argocd cert command are propagated across your cluster, depending on your Kubernetes setup. Note When importing SSH known hosts key from a known_hosts file, the hostnames or IP addresses in the input data must not be hashed. If your known_hosts file contains hashed entries, it cannot be used as input source for adding SSH known hosts - neither in the CLI nor in the UI. If you absolutely wish to use hashed known hosts data, the only option will be using declarative setup (see below). Be aware that this will break CLI and UI certificate management, so it is generally not recommended. Managing SSH Known Hosts using the CLI \u00b6 You can list all configured SSH known host entries using the argocd cert list command with the --cert-type ssh modifier: $ argocd cert list --cert-type ssh HOSTNAME TYPE SUBTYPE FINGERPRINT/SUBJECT bitbucket.org ssh ssh-rsa SHA256:zzXQOXSRBEiUtuE8AikJYKwbHaxvSc0ojez9YXaGp1A github.com ssh ssh-rsa SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 gitlab.com ssh ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw gitlab.com ssh ssh-ed25519 SHA256:eUXGGm1YGsMAS7vkcx6JOJdOGHPem5gQp4taiCfCLB8 gitlab.com ssh ssh-rsa SHA256:ROQFvPThGrW4RuWLoL9tq9I9zJ42fK4XywyRtbOz/EQ ssh.dev.azure.com ssh ssh-rsa SHA256:ohD8VZEXGWo6Ez8GSEJQ9WpafgLFsOfLOtGGQCQo6Og vs-ssh.visualstudio.com ssh ssh-rsa SHA256:ohD8VZEXGWo6Ez8GSEJQ9WpafgLFsOfLOtGGQCQo6Og For adding SSH known host entries, the argocd cert add-ssh command can be used. You can either add from a file (using the --from <file> modifier), or by reading stdin when the --batch modifier was specified. In both cases, input must be in known_hosts format as understood by the OpenSSH client. Example for adding all available SSH public host keys for a server to ArgoCD, as collected by ssh-keyscan : ssh-keyscan server.example.com | argocd cert add-ssh --batch Example for importing an existing known_hosts file to ArgoCD: argocd cert add-ssh --batch --from /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts Finally, SSH known host entries can be removed using the argocd cert rm command with the --cert-type ssh modifier: argocd cert rm bitbucket.org --cert-type ssh If you have multiple SSH known host entries for a given host with different key sub-types (e.g. as for gitlab.com in the example above, there are keys of sub-types ssh-rsa , ssh-ed25519 and ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ) and you want to only remove one of them, you can further narrow down the selection using the --cert-sub-type modifier: argocd cert rm gitlab.com --cert-type ssh --cert-sub-type ssh-ed25519 Managing SSH known hosts data using the ArgoCD web UI \u00b6 It is possible to add and remove SSH known hosts entries using the ArgoCD web UI: In the navigation pane to the left, click on \"Settings\" and choose \"Certificates\" from the settings menu The following page lists all currently configured certificates and provides you with the option to add either a new TLS certificate or SSH known entries: Click on \"Add SSH known hosts\" and paste your SSH known hosts data in the following mask. Important : Make sure there are no line breaks in the entries (key data) when you paste the data. Afterwards, click on \"Create\". To remove a certificate, click on the small three-dotted button next to the certificate entry, select \"Remove\" from the pop-up menu and confirm the removal in the following dialogue. Managing SSH known hosts data using declarative setup \u00b6 You can also manage SSH known hosts entries in a declarative, self-managed ArgoCD setup. All SSH public host keys are stored in the ConfigMap object argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm . For more details, please refer to the Operator Manual Before v1.2 (1) You can customize the Argo CD Docker image by adding the host's SSH public key to /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts . Additional entries to this file can be generated using the ssh-keyscan utility (e.g. ssh-keyscan your-private-git-server.com . For more information see example which demonstrates how /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts can be customized. Note The /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts should include Git host on each Argo CD deployment as well as on a computer where argocd repo add is executed. After resolving issue #1514 only argocd-repo-server deployment has to be customized. (1) Add repository using Argo CD CLI and --insecure-ignore-host-key flag: argocd repo add git@github.com:argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git --ssh-private-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa --insecure-ignore-host-key Don't use in production The --insecure-ignore-host-key should not be used in production as this is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. This does not work for Kustomize remote bases or custom plugins For Kustomize support, see #827 . Git Submodules \u00b6 v1.4 or later Submodules are supported and will be picked up automatically.

In order to change the project of an app, the user must have permissions to access the new project. argocd app set guestbook-default --project myproject Project Roles \u00b6 Projects include a feature called roles that enable automated access to a project's applications. These can be used to give a CI pipeline a restricted set of permissions. For example, a CI system may only be able to sync a single app (but not change its source or destination). Projects can have multiple roles, and those roles can have different access granted to them. These permissions are called policies, and they are stored within the role as a list of policy strings. A role's policy can only grant access to that role and are limited to applications within the role's project. However, the policies have an option for granting wildcard access to any application within a project. In order to create roles in a project and add policies to a role, a user will need permission to update a project. The following commands can be used to manage a role. argocd proj role list argocd proj role get argocd proj role create argocd proj role delete argocd proj role add-policy argocd proj role remove-policy Project roles in itself are not useful without generating a token to associate to that role. Argo CD supports JWT tokens as the means to authenticate to a role. Since the JWT token is associated with a role's policies, any changes to the role's policies will immediately take effect for that JWT token. The following commands are used to manage the JWT tokens. argocd proj role create-token PROJECT ROLE-NAME argocd proj role delete-token PROJECT ROLE-NAME ISSUED-AT Since the JWT tokens aren't stored in Argo CD, they can only be retrieved when they are created. A user can leverage them in the cli by either passing them in using the --auth-token flag or setting the ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable. The JWT tokens can be used until they expire or are revoked. The JWT tokens can created with or without an expiration, but the default on the cli is creates them without an expirations date. Even if a token has not expired, it cannot be used if the token has been revoked. Below is an example of leveraging a JWT token to access a guestbook application. It makes the assumption that the user already has a project named myproject and an application called guestbook-default.
