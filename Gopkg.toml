# Packages should only be added to the following list when we use them *outside* of our go code.
# (e.g. we want to build the binary to invoke as part of the build process, such as in
# generate-proto.sh). Normal use of golang packages should be added via `dep ensure`, and pinned
# with a [[constraint]] or [[override]] when version is important.
