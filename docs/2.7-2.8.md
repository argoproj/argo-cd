# 2.7 to 2.8

## Tini as entrypoint

With the 2.8 release `entrypoint.sh` will be removed from the containers, because starting with 2.7, the implicit entrypoint is set to `tini` in the `Dockerfile` explicitly, and the kubernetes manifests has been updated to use it. Simply updating the containers without updating the deployment manifests will result in pod startup failures, as the old manifests are relying on `entrypoint.sh` instead of `tini`. Please make sure the manifests are updated properly before moving to 2.8.
