The Argo CD UI displays icons for various Kubernetes resource types to help users quickly identify them. Argo CD 
includes a set of built-in icons for common resource types.

You can contribute additional icons for custom resource types by following these steps:

1. Ensure the license is compatible with Apache 2.0.
2. Add the icon file to the `resource_customizations/<group>/<kind>/icon.svg` path in the Argo CD repository.
3. Modify the SVG to use the correct color, `#8fa4b1`.
4. Create a pull request to the Argo CD repository with your changes.
