# UI Extensions

Argo CD web user interface can be extended with additional UI elements. Extensions should be delivered as a javascript file
in the `argocd-server` Pods that are placed in the `/tmp/extensions` directory and starts with `extension` prefix ( matches to `^extension(.*)\.js$` regex ).

```
/tmp/extensions
├── example1
│   └── extension-1.js
└── example2
    └── extension-2.js
```

Extensions are loaded during initial page rendering and should register themselves using API exposed in the `extensionsAPI` global variable. (See
corresponding extension type details for additional information).

The extension should provide a React component that is responsible for rendering the UI element. Extension should not bundle the React library.
Instead extension should use the `react` global variable. You can leverage `externals` setting if you are using webpack:

```js
  externals: {
    react: 'React'
  }
```

## Resource Tab Extensions

Resource Tab extensions is an extension that provides an additional tab for the resource sliding panel at the Argo CD Application details page.

The resource tab extension should be registered using the `extensionsAPI.registerResourceExtension` method:

```typescript
registerResourceExtension(component: ExtensionComponent, group: string, kind: string, tabTitle: string)
```



* `component: ExtensionComponent` is a React component that receives the following properties:

    * resource: State - the kubernetes resource object;
    * tree: ApplicationTree - includes list of all resources that comprise the application;

    See properties interfaces in [models.ts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/ui/src/app/shared/models.ts)

* `group: string` - the glob expression that matches the group of the resource;
* `kind: string` - the glob expression that matches the kind of the resource;
* `tabTitle: string` - the extension tab title.

Below is an example of a resource tab extension:

```javascript
((window) => {
    const component = () => {
        return React.createElement( 'div', {}, 'Hello World' );
    };
    window.extensionsAPI.registerResourceExtension(component, '*', '*', 'Nice extension');
})(window)
```
