# Compare Options

## Ignoring Resources That Needs Pruning

You may wish to exclude resources for the app's overall sync status under certain circumstances, for example if they are generated by the tool. This can be done by adding an annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreNeedsPruning
```

!!! note
    This only affect the sync status. If the resource's health is degraded, then the app will also be degraded.

Kustomize has a feature that allows you to generate config maps ([read more  ⧉](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/configGeneration.md)). You can set `generatorOptions` to add this annotation so that your app remains in sync:

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: my-map
    literals:
      - foo=bar
generatorOptions:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreNeedsPruning
kind: Kustomization
``` 
 
!!! note
    `generatorOptions` adds annotations to both config maps and secrets ([read more ⧉](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/generatorOptions.md)).
