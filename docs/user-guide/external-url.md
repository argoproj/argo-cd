# External URL Links

ArgoCD automatically generates clickable links to external pages that your application exposes.
This is usually done via detecting hosts / URLs from your `Ingress` resources.

## Add external URL

You can add additional external links to Argo CD dashboard. For example
links to monitoring pages or documentation, instead of just ingress hosts or other apps.

ArgoCD generates clickable links to external pages for a resource based on per resource annotation.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-svc
  annotations:
    link.argocd.argoproj.io/external-link: http://my-grafana.example.com/pre-generated-link
```
![External link](../assets/external-link.png)

The external link icon will be visible for respective resource on ArgoCD application details page.

## Ignore autogenerated external URLs

If an ingress object should be ignored by ArgoCD's autodetection of external URLs, such as a dummy ingress
pointing to a 404 page, you can add the `argocd.argoproj.io/ignore-default-links: "true"` annotation. This will
remove any links inferred from the ingress spec from the ArgoCD UI. Any links added by `link.argocd.argoproj.io`
annotations are unchanged.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    link.argocd.argoproj.io/external-link: https://optional.show-me-instead.example.com/
    argocd.argoproj.io/ignore-default-links: "true"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: dont-show-me.internal.example.com
    ...
```
