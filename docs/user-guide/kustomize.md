!!! warning Kustomize 1 vs 2
    Argo CD supports both versions, and auto-detects then by looking for `apiVersion/kind` is `kustomize.yaml`. 
    You're probably using version 2 now, so make sure you you have those fields.
    
You have three configuration options for Kustomize:

* `namePrefix` is a prefix appended to resources for Kustomize apps
* `imageTags` is a list of Kustomize 1.0 image tag overrides
* `images` is a list of Kustomize 2.0 image overrides
    
To use Kustomize with an overlay, point your path to the overlay.
