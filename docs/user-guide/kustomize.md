# Kustomize

You have three configuration options for Kustomize:

* `namePrefix` is a prefix appended to resources for Kustomize apps
* `images` is a list of Kustomize image overrides
    
To use Kustomize with an overlay, point your path to the overlay.

!!! tip
    If you're generating resources, you should read up how to ignore those generated resources using the [`IgnoreExtraneous` compare option](compare-options.md).

## Private Remote Bases

If you have remote bases that are either (a) HTTPS and need username/password (b) SSH and need SSH private key, then they'll inherit that from the app's repo. 

This will work if the remote bases uses the same credentials/private key. It will not work if they use different ones. For security reasons your app only ever knows about it's own repo (not other team's or users repos), and so you won't be able to access other private repo, even if Argo CD knows about them.

Read more about [private repos](private-repositories.md).

## `kustomize build` Options/Parameters

To provide build options to `kustomize build` add a property to the ArgoCD CM under data:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
    kustomize.buildOptions: --load_restrictor none
```
