# Sync Status Options

## Ignoring Resources

You may wish to exclude resources for the app's overall sync status under certain circumstances, for example if they are generated by the tool. This can be done by adding an annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-status-options: Ignore
```

!!! note
    This only affect the sync status. If the resource's health is degraded, then the app will also be degraded.

Kustomize has a feature that allows you to generate config maps. You can set `generatorOptions` to add this annotation so that your app remains in sync:

```yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: my-map
    literals:
      - foo=bar
generatorOptions:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-status-options: Ignore
kind: Kustomization
```
