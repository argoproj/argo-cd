# Tools

Argo CD supports several different ways in which Kubernetes manifests can be defined:

* [Kustomize](kustomize.md) applications
* [Helm](helm.md) charts
* [Ksonnet](ksonnet.md) applications
* A directory of YAML/JSO/Jsonnet manifests
* Any [custom config management tool](config-management-plugins.md) configured as a config management plugin
