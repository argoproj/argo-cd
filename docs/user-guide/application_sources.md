# Tools

## Production

Argo CD supports several different ways in which Kubernetes manifests can be defined:

* [Kustomize](kustomize.md) applications
* [Helm](helm.md) charts
* [Ksonnet](ksonnet.md) applications
* A directory of YAML/JSON/Jsonnet manifests
* Any [custom config management tool](config-management-plugins.md) configured as a config management plugin

## Development
Argo CD also supports uploading local manifests directly. Since this is an anti-pattern of the
GitOps paradigm, this should only be done for development purposes. A user with an `override` permission is required
to upload manifests locally (typically an admin). All of the different Kubernetes deployment tools above are supported.
To upload a local application:

```bash
$ argocd app sync APPNAME --local /path/to/dir/
```
