# SSO Configuration

## Overview

Argo CD does not have any local users other than the built-in `admin` user. All other users are
expected to login via SSO. There are two ways that SSO can be configured:

* Bundled Dex OIDC provider - use this option if your current provider does not support OIDC (e.g. SAML,
  LDAP) or if you wish to leverage any of Dex's connector features (e.g. the ability to map GitHub
  organizations and teams to OIDC groups claims).

* Existing OIDC provider - use this if you already have an OIDC provider which you are using (e.g.
  Okta, OneLogin, Auth0, Microsoft), where you manage your users, groups, and memberships.

## Dex

Argo CD embeds and bundles [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex) as part of its installation, for the
purpose of delegating authentication to an external identity provider. Multiple types of identity
providers are supported (OIDC, SAML, LDAP, GitHub, etc...). SSO configuration of Argo CD requires
editing the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap with
[Dex connector](https://github.com/coreos/dex/tree/master/Documentation/connectors) settings.

This document describes how to configure Argo CD SSO using GitHub (OAuth2) as an example, but the
steps should be similar for other identity providers.

### 1. Register the application in the identity provider

In GitHub, register a new application. The callback address should be the `/api/dex/callback`
endpoint of your Argo CD URL (e.g. https://argocd.example.com/api/dex/callback).

![Register OAuth App](../assets/register-app.png "Register OAuth App")

After registering the app, you will receive an OAuth2 client ID and secret. These values will be
inputted into the Argo CD configmap.

![OAuth2 Client Config](../assets/oauth2-config.png "OAuth2 Client Config")

### 2. Configure Argo CD for SSO

Edit the argocd-cm configmap:

```bash
kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocd
```

* In the `url` key, input the base URL of Argo CD. In this example, it is https://argocd.example.com
* In the `dex.config` key, add the `github` connector to the `connectors` sub field. See Dex's
  [GitHub connector](https://github.com/coreos/dex/blob/master/Documentation/connectors/github.md)
  documentation for explanation of the fields. A minimal config should populate the clientID,
  clientSecret generated in Step 1.
* You will very likely want to restrict logins to one or more GitHub organization. In the
  `connectors.config.orgs` list, add one or more GitHub organizations. Any member of the org will
  then be able to login to Argo CD to perform management tasks.

```yaml
data:
  url: https://argocd.example.com

  dex.config: |
    connectors:
      # GitHub example
      - type: github
        id: github
        name: GitHub
        config:
          clientID: aabbccddeeff00112233
          clientSecret: $dex.github.clientSecret
          orgs:
          - name: your-github-org

      # GitHub enterprise example
      - type: github
        id: acme-github
        name: Acme GitHub
        config:
          hostName: github.acme.com
          clientID: abcdefghijklmnopqrst
          clientSecret: $dex.acme.clientSecret
          orgs:
          - name: your-github-org
```

After saving, the changes should take affect automatically.

NOTES:

* Any values which start with '$' will look to a key in argocd-secret of the same name (minus the $),
  to obtain the actual value. This allows you to store the `clientSecret` as a kubernetes secret.
* There is no need to set `redirectURI` in the `connectors.config` as shown in the dex documentation.
  Argo CD will automatically use the correct `redirectURI` for any OAuth2 connectors, to match the
  correct external callback URL (e.g. https://argocd.example.com/api/dex/callback)


## Existing OIDC Provider 

To configure Argo CD to delegate authenticate to your existing OIDC provider, add the OAuth2
configuration to the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap under the `oidc.config` key:

```yaml
data:
  url: https://argocd.example.com

  oidc.config: |
    name: Okta
    issuer: https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com
    clientID: aaaabbbbccccddddeee
    clientSecret: $oidc.okta.clientSecret

    # Optional set of OIDC scopes to request. If omitted, defaults to: ["openid", "profile", "email", "groups"]
    requestedScopes: ["openid", "profile", "email", "groups"]

    # Optional set of OIDC claims to request on the ID token.
    requestedIDTokenClaims: {"groups": {"essential": true}}

    # Some OIDC providers require a separate clientID for different callback URLs.
    # For example, if configuring Argo CD with self-hosted Dex, you will need a separate client ID
    # for the 'localhost' (CLI) client to Dex. This field is optional. If omitted, the CLI will
    # use the same clientID as the Argo CD server
    cliClientID: vvvvwwwwxxxxyyyyzzzz
```

### Requesting additional ID token claims

Not all OIDC providers support a special `groups` scope. E.g. Okta, OneLogin and Microsoft do support a special
`groups` scope and will return group membership with the default `requestedScopes`.

Other OIDC providers might be able to return a claim with group membership if explicitly requested to do so.
Individual claims can be requested with `requestedIDTokenClaims`, see
[OpenID Connect Claims Parameter](https://connect2id.com/products/server/docs/guides/requesting-openid-claims#claims-parameter)
for details. The Argo CD configuration for claims is as follows:

```yaml
  oidc.config: |
    requestedIDTokenClaims:
      email:
        essential: true
      groups:
        essential: true
        value: org:myorg
      acr:
        essential: true
        values:
        - urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver
        - urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze
```

For a simple case this can be:

```yaml
  oidc.config: |
    requestedIDTokenClaims: {"groups": {"essential": true}}
```
