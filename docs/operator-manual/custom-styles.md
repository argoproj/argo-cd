# Custom Styles

Argo CD has imports the majority of its UI stylesheets from the [argo-ui](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-ui) project.
Sometimes, it may be desired to customize certain components of the UI for branding purposes or to
help distinguish between multiple instances of Argo CD running in different environments.

Such custom styling can be applied either by supplying a URL to a remotely hosted CSS file, or by 
loading a CSS file directly onto the argocd-server container.  Both mechanisms are drievn by modifying
the argocd-cm configMap.

## Adding Styles Via Remote URL

The first method simply requires the addition of the remote URL to the argocd-cm configMap:

### argocd-cm
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  ui.cssurl: "https://www.myhost.com/my-styles.css"
```

## Adding Styles Via Volume Mounts

The second method requires mounting the CSS file directly onto the argocd-server container and then
providing the argocd-cm with the properly configured path to that file.  In the following example,
the CSS file is actually defined inside of a separate configMap (the same effect could be achieved
by generating or downloading a CSS file in an initContainer):

### argocd-cm
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  ui.cssurl: "./custom/my-styles.css"
```

Note that the `cssurl` should be specified relative to the "/shared/app" directory; 
not as an absolute path.

### argocd-styles-cm
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
  name: argocd-styles-cm
data:
  my-styles.css: |
    .nav-bar {
      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #999, #777, #333, #222, #111);
    }
```

### argocd-server
```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: argocd-server
  ...
spec:
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        ...
        volumeMounts:
        ...
        - mountPath: /shared/app/custom
          name: styles
      ...
      volumes:
      ...
      - configMap:
          name: argocd-styles-cm
        name: styles
```

Note that the CSS file should be mounted within a subdirectory of the existing "/shared/app" directory
(e.g. "/shared/app/custom").  Otherwise, the file will likely fail to be imported by the browser with an
"incorrect MIME type" error.

## Developing Style Overlays
The styles specified in the injected CSS file should be specific to components and classes defined in [argo-ui](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-ui).
It is recommended to test out the styles you wish to apply first by making use of your browser's built-in developer tools.  For a more full-featured
experience, you may wish to build a separate project using the [Argo CD UI dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
