# Declarative Setup

Argo CD applications, projects and settings can be defined declaratively using Kubernetes manifests.

## Quick Reference
| Name | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [`argocd-cm.yaml`](argocd-cm.yaml) | ConfigMap | General Argo CD configuration |
| [`argocd-secret.yaml`](argocd-secret.yaml) | Secret | Password, Certificates, Signing Key |
| [`argocd-rbac-cm.yaml`](argocd-rbac-cm.yaml) | ConfigMap | RBAC Configuration |
| [`application.yaml`](application.yaml) | Application | Example application spec |
| [`project.yaml`](project.yaml) | AppProject | Example project spec |

## Applications

The Application CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a deployed application instance
in an environment. It is defined by two key pieces of information:

* `source` reference to the desired state in Git (repository, revision, path, environment)
* `destination` reference to the target cluster and namespace.

A minimal Application spec is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: guestbook
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: guestbook
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: guestbook
```

See [application.yaml](application.yaml) for additional fields

!!! warning
    By default, deleting an application will not perform a cascade delete, thereby deleting its resources. You must add the finalizer if you want this behaviour - which you may well not want.
    
```yaml
metadata:
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
```

### Application of Applications

You can create an application that creates other applications, which in turn can create other applications. 
This allows you to declaratively manage a group of applications that can be deployed and configured in concert.

See [cluster bootstrapping](cluster-bootstrapping.md).

## Projects
The AppProject CRD is the Kubernetes resource object representing a logical grouping of applications.
It is defined by the following key pieces of information:

* `sourceRepos` reference to the repositories that applications within the project can pull manifests from.
* `destinations` reference to clusters and namespaces that applications within the project can deploy into.
* `roles` list of entities with definitions of their access to resources within the project.

An example spec is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: my-project
spec:
  description: Example Project
  # Allow manifests to deploy from any Git repos
  sourceRepos:
  - '*'
  # Only permit applications to deploy to the guestbook namespace in the same cluster
  destinations:
  - namespace: guestbook
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  # Deny all cluster-scoped resources from being created, except for Namespace
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
  - group: ''
    kind: Namespace
  # Allow all namespaced-scoped resources to be created, except for ResourceQuota, LimitRange, NetworkPolicy
  namespaceResourceBlacklist:
  - group: ''
    kind: ResourceQuota
  - group: ''
    kind: LimitRange
  - group: ''
    kind: NetworkPolicy
  roles:
  # A role which provides read-only access to all applications in the project
  - name: read-only
    description: Read-only privileges to my-project
    policies:
    - p, proj:my-project:read-only, applications, get, my-project/*, allow
    groups:
    - my-oidc-group
  # A role which provides sync privileges to only the guestbook-dev application, e.g. to provide
  # sync privileges to a CI system
  - name: ci-role
    description: Sync privileges for guestbook-dev
    policies:
    - p, proj:my-project:ci-role, applications, sync, my-project/guestbook-dev, allow
    # NOTE: JWT tokens can only be generated by the API server and the token is not persisted
    # anywhere by Argo CD. It can be prematurely revoked by removing the entry from this list.
    jwtTokens:
    - iat: 1535390316
```

## Repositories

Repository credentials are stored in secret. Use following steps to configure a repo:

1. Create secret which contains repository credentials. Consider using [bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) to store encrypted secret
definition as a Kubernetes manifest.
2. Register repository in the `argocd-cm` config map. Each repository must have `url` field and, depending on whether you connect using HTTPS or SSH, `usernameSecret` and `passwordSecret` (for HTTPS) or `sshPrivateKeySecret` (for SSH).

Example for HTTPS:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  repositories: |
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj/my-private-repository
      passwordSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: password
      usernameSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: username
```

Example for SSH:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  repositories: |
    - url: git@github.com:argoproj/my-private-repository
      sshPrivateKeySecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: sshPrivateKey
```

!!! tip
    The Kubernetes documentation has [instructions for creating a secret containing a private key](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#use-case-pod-with-ssh-keys). 


### Repository Credentials (v1.1+)

If you want to use the same credentials for multiple repositories, you can use `repository.credentials`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  repositories: |
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj/private-repo
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj/other-private-repo
  repository.credentials: |
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj
      passwordSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: password
      usernameSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: username
```

Argo CD will only use the credentials if you omit `usernameSecret`, `passwordSecret`, and `sshPrivateKeySecret` fields (`insecureIgnoreHostKey` is ignored).

A credential may be match if it's URL is the prefix of the repository's URL. The means that credentials may match, e.g in the above example both [https://github.com/argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj) and [https://github.com](https://github.com) would match. Argo CD selects the first one that matches.

!!! tip
    Order your credentials with the most specific at the top and the least specific at the bottom. 

A complete example.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  repositories: |
    # this has it's own credentials
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj/private-repo
      passwordSecret:
        name: private-repo-secret
        key: password
      usernameSecret:
        name: private-repo-secret
        key: username
      sshPrivateKeySecret:
        name: private-repo-secret
        key: sshPrivateKey
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj/other-private-repo
    - url: https://github.com/otherproj/another-private-repo
  repository.credentials: |
    # this will be used for the second repo
    - url: https://github.com/argoproj
      passwordSecret:
        name: other-private-repo-secret
        key: password
      usernameSecret:
        name: other-private-repo-secret
        key: username
      sshPrivateKeySecret:
        name: other-private-repo-secret
        key: sshPrivateKey
    # this will be used for the third repo
    - url: https://github.com
      passwordSecret:
        name: another-private-repo-secret
        key: password
      usernameSecret:
        name: another-private-repo-secret
        key: username
      sshPrivateKeySecret:
        name: another-private-repo-secret
        key: sshPrivateKey
```


## Clusters

Cluster credentials are stored in secrets same as repository credentials but does not require entry in `argocd-cm` config map. Each secret must have label
`argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster`.

The secret data must include following fields:

* `name` - cluster name
* `server` - cluster api server url
* `config` - JSON representation of following data structure:

```yaml
# Basic authentication settings
username: string
password: string
# Bearer authentication settings
bearerToken: string
# IAM authentication configuration
awsAuthConfig:
    clusterName: string
    roleARN: string
# Transport layer security configuration settings
tlsClientConfig:
    # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate file).
    caData: string
    # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate file).
    certData: string
    # Server should be accessed without verifying the TLS certificate
    insecure: boolean
    # PEM-encoded bytes (typically read from a client certificate key file).
    keyData: string
    # ServerName is passed to the server for SNI and is used in the client to check server
    # ceritificates against. If ServerName is empty, the hostname used to contact the
    # server is used.
    serverName: string
```


Cluster secret example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mycluster-secret
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster
type: Opaque
stringData:
  name: mycluster.com
  server: https://mycluster.com
  config: |
    {
      "bearerToken": "<authentication token>",
      "tlsClientConfig": {
        "insecure": false,
        "caData": "<base64 encoded certificate>"
      }
    }
```

## Helm Chart Repositories

Non standard Helm Chart repositories have to be registered under the `helm.repositories` key in the
`argocd-cm` ConfigMap. Each repository must have `url` and `name` fields. For private Helm repos you
may need to configure access credentials and HTTPS settings using `usernameSecret`, `passwordSecret`,
`caSecret`, `certSecret` and `keySecret` fields.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  helm.repositories: |
    - url: https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-prerelease/daily-build/master-latest-daily/charts
      name: istio.io
    - url: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
      name: argo
      usernameSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: username
      passwordSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: password
      caSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: ca
      certSecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: cert
      keySecret:
        name: my-secret
        key: key
```

## Resource Exclusion

Resources can be excluded from discovery and sync so that ArgoCD is unaware of them. For example, `events.k8s.io` and `metrics.k8s.io` are always excluded. Use cases:

* You have temporal issues and you want to exclude problematic resources.
* There are many of a kind of resources that impacts ArgoCD's performance.
* Restrict ArgoCD's access to certain kinds of resources, e.g. secrets. See [security.md#cluster-rbac](security.md#cluster-rbac).

To configure this, edit the `argcd-cm` config map:

```
kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocdconfigmap/argocd-cm edited
```

Add `resource.exclusions`, e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  resource.exclusions: |
    - apiGroups:
      - "*"
      kinds:
      - "*"
      clusters:
      - https://192.168.0.20
kind: ConfigMap
```

The `resource.exclusions` node is a list of objects. Each object can have:

- `apiGroups` A list of globs to match the API group.
- `kinds` A list of kinds to match. Can be "*" to match all.
- `cluster` A list of globs to match the cluster.

If all three match, then the resource is ignored.

Notes:

* Quote globs in your YAML to avoid parsing errors.
* Invalid globs result in the whole rule being ignored.
* If you add a rule that matches existing resources, these will appear in the interface as `OutOfSync`.

## Manage Argo CD Using Argo CD

Argo CD is able to manage itself since all settings are represented by Kubernetes manifests. The suggested way is to create [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
based application which uses base Argo CD manifests from [https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd] and apply required changes on top.

Example of `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
bases:
- github.com/argoproj/argo-cd//manifests/cluster-install?ref=v1.0.1

# additional resources like ingress rules, cluster and repository secrets.
resources:
- clusters-secrets.yaml
- repos-secrets.yaml

# changes to config maps
patchesStrategicMerge:
- overlays/argo-cd-cm.yaml
```

The live example of self managed Argo CD config is available at https://cd.apps.argoproj.io and with configuration
stored at [argoproj/argoproj-deployments](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj-deployments/tree/master/argocd).

    You will need to sign-in using your github account to get access to https://cd.apps.argoproj.io
