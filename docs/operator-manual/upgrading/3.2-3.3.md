# v3.2 to 3.3

## Breaking Changes

### Anonymous call to Settings API returns fewer fields

The Settings API now returns less information when accessed anonymously.
It no longer returns the `resourceOverrides` field which is considered sensitive information.

### New ENV Variable to control K8s Server Side Timeout of API Requests

The new environment variable `ARGOCD_K8S_SERVER_SIDE_TIMEOUT` can be used to control the K8s server side timeout of API requests.
The default value is 30 seconds. In 3.2 and before this change, the K8s server side timeout was controlled by `ARGOCD_K8S_TCP_TIMEOUT` 
which is also used to control the TCP timeout when communicating with the K8s API server. 
Now it's clearer and the K8s server side timeout is controlled by a separate environment variable.
