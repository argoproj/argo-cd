## Kustomize Upgraded to 5.8.0

Argo CD v3.3 upgrades the bundled Kustomize version from v5.7.0 to v5.8.0. According to the
[5.7.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.7.1)
and [5.8.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.8.0) release notes, there are no breaking changes.

However, note that Kustomize 5.7.1 introduces code to replace the `shlex` library used for parsing arguments in exec plugins.
If any existing manifests become corrupted, please follow the instructions in the
[5.7.1 release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.7.1).

Kustomize 5.8.0 also resolves an issue where namespaces were not properly propagated to Helm charts.
If you rely on Helm charts within kustomization files, please review the details in the associated fix:
[kubernetes-sigs/kustomize#5940](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5940).

## Breaking Changes

### Anonymous call to Settings API returns fewer fields

The Settings API now returns less information when accessed anonymously.
It no longer returns the `resourceOverrides` field which is considered sensitive information.

### New ENV Variable to control K8s Server Side Timeout of API Requests

The new environment variable `ARGOCD_K8S_SERVER_SIDE_TIMEOUT` can be used to control the K8s server side timeout of API requests.
In 3.2 and before this change, the K8s server side timeout was controlled by `ARGOCD_K8S_TCP_TIMEOUT` 
which is also used to control the TCP timeout when communicating with the K8s API server. 
From now onwards, the Kubernetes server-side timeout is controlled by a separate environment variable.
