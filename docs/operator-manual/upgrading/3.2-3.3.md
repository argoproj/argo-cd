## ApplicationService API return code

The Application Service API used to return a `PermissionDenied` error instead of `NotFound` when the optional `project` parameter was
not provided in the query. This was to ensure that users have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources and
prevent a possible application enumeration.

This made it impossible for a user to determine whether a specific application existed, without having to LIST all applications. To remediate this,
the API now returns a `NotFound` error when the `project` parameter is not provided **AND** the user has explicit permissions to _ALL_ Applications.

This allows users with a permission such as `p, role:all-app-access, applications, get, */*, allow` to determine the existence of an application
without needing to know the specific project it belongs to, and without needing to list all applications.

_Note_: If the RBAC `policy.matchMode` is set to `regex` (default is `glob`), the permission's object will need to match the value of `*/*`.
