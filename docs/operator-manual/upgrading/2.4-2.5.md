# v2.4 to 2.5

## argocd-cm plugins (CMPs) are deprecated

Starting with Argo CD v2.5, installing config management plugins (CMPs) via the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap is deprecated.
Support will be removed in v2.6.

You can continue to use the plugins by [installing them as sidecars](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config-management-plugins/)
on the repo-server Deployment.

Sidecar plugins are significantly more secure. Plugin code runs in its own container with an almost completely-isolated
filesystem. If an attacker compromises a plugin, the attacker's ability to cause harm is significantly mitigated.

To determine whether argocd-cm plugins are still in use, scan your argocd-repo-server and argocd-server logs for the 
following message:

> argocd-cm plugins are deprecated, and support will be removed in v2.6. Upgrade your plugin to be installed via sidecar. https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config-management-plugins/

If you run `argocd app list` as admin, the list of Applications using deprecated plugins will be logged as a warning.

## Dex server TLS configuration

In order to secure the communications between the dex server and the Argo CD API server, TLS is now enabled by default on the dex server.

By default, without configuration, the dex server will generate a self-signed certificate upon startup. However, we recommend that users
configure their own TLS certificate using the `argocd-dex-server-tls` secret. Please refer to the [TLS configuration guide](../tls.md#configuring-tls-to-argocd-dex-server) for more information.

## Invalid users.session.duration values now fall back to 24h

Before v2.5, an invalid `users.session.duration` value in argocd-cm would 1) log a warning and 2) result in user sessions having no duration limit.

Starting with v2.5, invalid duration values will fall back to the default value of 24 hours with a warning.

## Out-of-bounds symlinks now blocked at fetch

There have been several path traversal and identification vulnerabilities disclosed in the past related to symlinks. To help prevent any further vulnerabilities, we now scan all repositories and Helm charts for **out of bounds symlinks** at the time they are fetched and block further processing if they are found.

An out-of-bounds symlink is defined as any symlink that leaves the root of the Git repository or Helm chart, even if the final target is within the root.

If an out of bounds symlink is found, a warning will be printed to the repo server console and an error will be shown in the UI or CLI.

Below is an example directory structure showing valid symlinks and invalid symlinks.

```
chart
├── Chart.yaml
├── values
│   └── values.yaml
├── bad-link.yaml   -> ../out-of-bounds.yaml       # Blocked
├── bad-link-2.yaml -> ../chart/values/values.yaml # Blocked because it leaves the root
├── bad-link-3.yaml -> /absolute/link.yaml         # Blocked
└── good-link.yaml  -> values/values.yaml          # OK
```

If you rely on out of bounds symlinks, this check can be disabled one of three ways:

1. The `--allow-oob-symlinks` argument on the repo server.
2. The `reposerver.allow.oob.symlinks` key if you are using `argocd-cmd-params-cm`
3. Directly setting `ARGOCD_REPO_SERVER_ALLOW_OOB_SYMLINKS` environment variable on the repo server.

It is **strongly recommended** to leave this check enabled. Disabling the check will not allow _all_ out-of-bounds symlinks. Those will still be blocked for things like values files in Helm charts, but symlinks which are not explicitly blocked by other checks will be allowed.
