# v2.4 to 2.5

## Dex server TLS configuration

In order to secure the communications between the dex server and the ArgoCD API server, TLS is now enabled by default on the dex server.

By default, without configuration, the dex server will generate a self-signed certificate upon startup. However, we recommend that users
configure their own TLS certificate using the `argocd-dex-server-tls` secret. Please refer to the [TLS configuration guide](../tls.md#configuring-tls-to-argocd-dex-server) for more information.

## Upgraded Kustomize Version

Note that bundled Kustomize version has been upgraded from 4.4.1 to 4.5.5.
