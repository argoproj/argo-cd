## Dex server TLS configuration

In order to secure the communications between the dex server and the Argo CD API server, TLS is now enabled by default on the dex server.

By default, without configuration, the dex server will generate a self-signed certificate upon startup. However, we recommend that users
configure their own TLS certificate using the `argocd-dex-server-tls` secret. Please refer to the [TLS configuration guide](../tls.md#configuring-tls-to-argocd-dex-server) for more information.

## Out-of-bounds symlinks now blocked at fetch

There have been several path traversal and identification vulnerabilities disclosed in the past related to symlinks. To help prevent any further vulnerabilities, we now scan all repositories and Helm charts for **out of bounds symlinks** at the time they are fetched and block further processing if they are found.

An out-of-bounds symlink is defined as any symlink that leaves the root of the Git repository or Helm chart, even if the final target is within the root.

If an out of bounds symlink is found, a warning will be printed to the repo server console and an error will be shown in the UI or CLI.

Below is an example directory structure showing valid symlinks and invalid symlinks.

```
chart
├── Chart.yaml
├── values
│   └── values.yaml
├── bad-link.yaml   -> ../out-of-bounds.yaml       # Blocked
├── bad-link-2.yaml -> ../chart/values/values.yaml # Blocked because it leaves the root
├── bad-link-3.yaml -> /absolute/link.yaml         # Blocked
└── good-link.yaml  -> values/values.yaml          # OK
```

If you rely on out of bounds symlinks, this check can be disabled one of three ways:

1. The `--allow-oob-symlinks` argument on the repo server.
2. The `reposerver.allow.oob.symlinks` key if you are using `argocd-cmd-params-cm`
3. Directly setting `ARGOCD_REPO_SERVER_ALLOW_OOB_SYMLINKS` environment variable on the repo server.

It is **strongly recommended** to leave this check enabled. Disabling the check will not allow _all_ out-of-bounds symlinks. Those will still be blocked for things like values files in Helm charts, but symlinks which are not explicitly blocked by other checks will be allowed.

## Upgraded Kustomize Version
