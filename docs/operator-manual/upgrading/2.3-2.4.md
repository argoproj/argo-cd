# v2.3 to 2.4

## KSonnet support is removed

The [https://ksonnet.io/] had been deprecated in [2019](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/pull/914/files) and no longer maintained.
The time has come to remove it from the ArgoCD.

## Helm 2 support is removed

Helm 2 is not been officially supported since [Nov 2020](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-2-becomes-unsupported/). In order to ensure a smooth transition
Helm 2 support was preserved in the Argo CD. We feel that Helm 3 is stable and it is time to drop Helm 2 support.


## Configure RBAC to account for new `exec` resource

2.4 introduces a new `exec` [RBAC resource](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions).

When you upgrade to 2.4, RBAC policies with `*` in the resource field and `create` or `*` in the verb field will automatically grant the `exec` privilege.

To avoid granting the new privilege, replace the existing policy with a list of new policies explicitly listing the old resources.

The exec feature is [disabled by default](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#exec-resource), 
but it is still a good idea to double-check your RBAC configuration to enforce least necessary privileges.

### Example

Old:

```csv
p, role:org-admin, *, create, my-proj/*, allow
```

New:

```csv
p, role: org-admin, clusters, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, projects, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, applications, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, repositories, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, certificates, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, accounts, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role: org-admin, gpgkeys, create, my-proj/*, allow
```

## Enable logs RBAC enforcement

2.4 introduced `logs` as a new RBAC resource. In 2.3, users with `applications, get` access automatically get logs
access. In 2.5, you will have to explicitly grant `logs, get` access. Logs RBAC enforcement can be enabled with a flag
in 2.4. We recommend enabling the flag now for an easier upgrade experience in 2.5.

To enabled logs RBAC enforcement, add this to your argocd-cm ConfigMap:

```yaml
server.rbac.log.enforce.enable: "true"
```

If you want to allow the same users to continue to have logs access, just find every line that grants 
`applications, get` access and also grant `logs, get`. 

### Example

Old:

```csv
p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, get, staging-db-admins/*, allow

p, role:test-db-admins, applications, *, staging-db-admins/*, allow
```

New:

```csv
p, role:staging-db-admins, applications, get, staging-db-admins/*, allow
p, role:staging-db-admins, logs, get, staging-db-admins/*, allow

p, role:test-db-admins, applications, *, staging-db-admins/*, allow
p, role:test-db-admins, logs, get, staging-db-admins/*, allow
```

### Known UI issue

Currently, upon pressing the "LOGS" tab in pod view by users who don't have an explicit allow get logs policy, the red "unable to load data: Internal error" is received in the bottom of the screen, and "Failed to load data, please try again" is displayed.

## Remove the shared volume from any sidecar plugins

As a security enhancement, [sidecar plugins](../../user-guide/config-management-plugins.md#option-2-configure-plugin-via-sidecar)
no longer share the /tmp directory with the repo-server.

If you have one or more sidecar plugins enabled, replace the /tmp volume mount for each sidecar to use a volume specific 
to each plugin.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: argocd-repo-server
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-plugin-name
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /tmp
          name: your-plugin-name-tmp
      volumes:
        # Add this volume.
        - name: your-plugin-name-tmp
          emptyDir: {}
```
