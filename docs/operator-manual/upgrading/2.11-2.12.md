# v2.11 to 2.12

## Image Registry Change for `redis` and `haproxy`

Argo CD 2.12 upgraded its [upstream redis-ha Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dandydev-charts/redis-ha/)
version from 4.22.3 to 4.26.6.

As part of the upgrade, the image registry for `redis` and `haproxy` was changed from DockerHub to ECR.

Make sure that the registry change will work for your environment. One example of a problem would be that your 
environment can use Cosign to verify the image signature for DockerHub but not for ECR. You would need to make sure your 
Image Validation policy includes the AWS ECR as an approved registry. Please validate that the registry change is
acceptable before upgrading.

## Server-Side Apply Management of ApplicationSet Fields

### Summary

If you are using server-side apply with multiple field managers to manage a single `selector` or `labelSelector` field 
in an ApplicationSet, that field management must be changed to be atomic starting with 2.12. 

### Details

Argo CD 2.12 upgraded its controller-gen version from 0.4.1 to 0.14.0. As part of that change, several ApplicationSet
CRD fields now have `x-kubernetes-map-type: atomic`.

Each of the affected fields is a label selector with two child keys: `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`.

Prior to this change, two field managers could manage the `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` fields independently.
Starting with the 2.12 CRD, a single field manager must manage both of those fields. This behavior is in line with the
upstream behavior of the label selector struct.

See the [Kubernetes server-side apply merge strategy docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#merge-strategy)
for more information about the fields' behavior.

The affected ApplicationSet fields are the following (jq selector syntax):

* `.spec.generators[].selector`
* `.spec.generators[].cluster.selector`
* `.spec.generators[].clusterDecisionResource.labelSelector`
* `.spec.generators[].matrix.generators[].selector`
* `.spec.generators[].merge.generators[].selector`
