# v3.1 to 3.2

## Argo CD Now Respects Kustomize Version in `.argocd-source.yaml`

Argo CD provides a way to [override Application `spec.source` values](../../user-guide/parameters.md#store-overrides-in-git) 
using the `.argocd-source.yaml` file.

Before Argo CD v3.2, you could set the Kustomize version in the Application's `.spec.source.kustomize.version` field,
but you could not set it in the `.argocd-source.yaml` file.

Starting with Argo CD v3.2, you can now set the Kustomize version in the `.argocd-source.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
kustomize:
  version: v4.5.7
```

## Deprecated fields in the repo-server GRPC service

The repo-server's GRPC service is generally considered an internal API and is not recommended for use by external 
clients. No user-facing services or functionality have changed. However, if you are using the repo-server's GRPC service 
directly, please note field deprecations in the following messages.

The `kustomizeOptions.binaryPath` field in the `ManifestRequest` and `RepoServerAppDetailsQuery` messages has been 
deprecated. Instead of calculating the correct binary path client-side, the client is expected to populate the 
`kustomizeOptions.versions` field with the [configured Kustomize binary paths](../../user-guide/kustomize.md#custom-kustomize-versions). 
This allows the repo-server to select the correct binary path based on the Kustomize version configured in the 
Application's source field as well as any [overrides configured via git](../../user-guide/parameters.md#store-overrides-in-git).

The `kustomizeOptions.binaryPath` will continue to be respected when `kustomizeOptions.versions` is not set, but this is
not recommended. It will prevent overrides configured via git from being respected. The `kustomizeOptions.binaryPath` 
field will be removed in a future release.

If the repo-server encounters a request with the `kustomizeOptions.binaryPath` field set, it will log a warning message:

> kustomizeOptions.binaryPath is deprecated, use KustomizeOptions.versions instead

The `ManifestRequest` and `RepoServerAppDetailsQuery` messages are used by the following GRPC services: 
`GenerateManifest`, `GenerateManifestWithFiles`, and `GetAppDetails`.
