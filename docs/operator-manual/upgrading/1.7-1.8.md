# v1.7 to 1.8

## The argocd-application-controller converted to StatefulSet

The `argocd-application-controller` has been converted to StatefulSet. That means you need to manually delete `argocd-application-controller` Deployment after upgrading.
Similarly if you decided to rollback to v1.7 don't forget to delete `argocd-application-controller` StatefulSet.


## Health assessement of argoproj.io/Application CRD has been removed

The health assessement of `argoproj.io/Application` CRD has been removed (see [#3781](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/3781) for more information).
You might need to restore it if you are using app-of-apps pattern and orchestrating syncronization using sync waves. Add the following resource customization in
`argocd-cm` ConfigMap:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  resource.customizations: |
    argoproj.io/Application:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        hs.status = "Healthy"
        hs.message = ""
        if obj.status ~= nil then
          if obj.status.health ~= nil then
            hs.status = obj.status.health.status
            hs.message = obj.status.health.message
          end
        end
        return hs
```

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
