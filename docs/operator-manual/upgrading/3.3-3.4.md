## Health Aggregation for Suspended Jobs and CronJobs

The health aggregation behavior for suspended Jobs and CronJobs has changed to better reflect operational intent.

**New behavior:**

- Suspended Jobs now contribute `Healthy` status to Application health instead of `Suspended`
- Suspended CronJobs now contribute `Healthy` status to Application health instead of `Suspended`
- The individual resource still displays its actual status (`Suspended`) in the UI
- Only the aggregation into the Application's overall health is affected

**Rationale:**

Suspended Jobs and CronJobs are often intentionally suspended for operational reasons (e.g., DR scenarios, maintenance windows, manual-trigger jobs). Marking the entire Application as `Suspended` due to these resources was misleading.

**Impact:**

- Applications with suspended Jobs/CronJobs will now show `Healthy` instead of `Suspended` (if all other resources are healthy)
- Automation relying on Application health status to detect suspended Jobs/CronJobs should instead check individual resource statuses
- To restore the previous behavior for specific Job/CronJob resources, use the annotation: `argocd.argoproj.io/health-aggregate-overrides: 'Suspended=Suspended'`

## Applications with `Missing` health status

The behavior of Application health status has changed to be more consistent and informative. Previously, Applications would show `Missing` health status inconsistently depending on whether missing resources had built-in or custom health checks defined.

**New behavior:**

- Applications now show `Missing` health **only when ALL resources are missing** (e.g., before the first sync)
- Individual missing resources no longer affect the Application's overall health status
- The health status now reflects the aggregated health of **existing resources**
- The `OutOfSync` status already indicates when resources are missing, making the health status redundant for individual missing resources
- If the defined resource health check is explicitly returning `Missing` for an existing resource, that will still be reflected in the overall Application health

**Impact:**

- Applications with some missing resources will now show the health of their existing resources (e.g., `Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`) instead of `Missing`
- Automation relying on the Application Health status to detect missing resources should now check the Sync status for `OutOfSync` instead, and optionally inspect individual resource health if needed.
- Users can now distinguish between an Application that has never been synced (all resources missing = `Missing` health) vs. an Application with some resources deleted (shows health of remaining resources)
