### Applications with `Missing` health status

The behavior of Application health status has changed to be more consistent and informative. Previously, Applications would show `Missing` health status inconsistently depending on whether missing resources had built-in or custom health checks defined.

**New behavior:**

- Applications now show `Missing` health **only when ALL resources are missing** (e.g., before the first sync)
- Individual missing resources no longer affect the Application's overall health status
- The health status now reflects the aggregated health of **existing resources**
- The `OutOfSync` status already indicates when resources are missing, making the health status redundant for individual missing resources

**Impact:**

- Applications with some missing resources will now show the health of their existing resources (e.g., `Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`) instead of `Missing`
- This provides better visibility into the actual state of deployed resources
- Users can now distinguish between an Application that has never been synced (all resources missing = `Missing` health) vs. an Application with some resources deleted (shows health of remaining resources)
- If the defined resource health check is explicitly returning `Missing` for an existing resource, that will still be reflected in the overall Application health
