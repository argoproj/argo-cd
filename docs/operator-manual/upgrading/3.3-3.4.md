# v3.3 to 3.4

## Breaking Changes

The dependency `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv` was upgraded to v1.39.0.   
In this version, some of the rpc span and metric attributes have been renamed, along with some of the system and process metrics.   
Any Argo CD dashboards or alerts based on those fields need to be adjusted according to the [official OTEL release notes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/releases/tag/v1.40.0).

## Applications with `Missing` health status

The behavior of Application health status has changed to be more consistent and informative. Previously, Applications would show `Missing` health status inconsistently depending on whether missing resources had built-in or custom health checks defined.

**New behavior:**

- Applications now show `Missing` health **only when ALL resources are missing** (e.g., before the first sync)
- Individual missing resources no longer affect the Application's overall health status
- The health status now reflects the aggregated health of **existing resources**
- The `OutOfSync` status already indicates when resources are missing, making the health status redundant for individual missing resources
- If the defined resource health check is explicitly returning `Missing` for an existing resource, that will still be reflected in the overall Application health

**Impact:**

- Applications with some missing resources will now show the health of their existing resources (e.g., `Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`) instead of `Missing`
- Automation relying on the Application Health status to detect missing resources should now check the Sync status for `OutOfSync` instead, and optionally inspect individual resource health if needed.
- Users can now distinguish between an Application that has never been synced (all resources missing = `Missing` health) vs. an Application with some resources deleted (shows health of remaining resources)

## gRPC Service Config DNS Lookups Disabled by Default

ArgoCD components now disable gRPC service config lookups via DNS TXT records by default to prevent excessive DNS queries and timeouts in dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) Kubernetes environments.

**Background:**

gRPC clients by default attempt to discover service configuration by querying DNS TXT records for `_grpc_config.<hostname>`. In dual-stack environments, these lookups can result in excessive DNS queries and timeouts, causing repo-server crashes and sync failures.

**New behavior:**

- The environment variable `GRPC_ENABLE_TXT_SERVICE_CONFIG` is now set to `false` by default for all ArgoCD components
- This prevents gRPC from attempting DNS TXT record lookups for service configuration
- Most users do not use DNS TXT records for gRPC service configuration

**Impact:**

- **Positive**: Eliminates excessive DNS queries in dual-stack environments, preventing timeouts and improving reliability
- **Minimal**: The vast majority of users do not use DNS TXT records for gRPC service configuration and will see no functional change
- **Re-enablement**: Users who do rely on gRPC service config via DNS TXT records can re-enable this feature by setting the parameter `controller.grpc.enable.txt.service.config: "true"` in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap

**Example to re-enable (if needed):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cmd-params-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  controller.grpc.enable.txt.service.config: "true"
```
