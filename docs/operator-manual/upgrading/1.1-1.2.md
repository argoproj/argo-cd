# v1.1 to 1.2

## Kustomize
- Kustomize v1 support is removed. All kustomize charts are built using the same Kustomize version
- Kustomize v2.0.3 upgraded to v3.1.0 . We've noticed one backward incompatible change: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/42 . Starting v2.1.0 namespace prefix feature works with CRD ( which might cause renaming of generated resource definitions)


## ConfigMap labels

Argo CD config maps must be annotated with `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd` label. Make sure to apply updated
`install.yaml` manifest in addition to changing image version.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
