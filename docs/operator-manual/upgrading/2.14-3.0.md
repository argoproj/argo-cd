# v2.14 to 3.0

Argo CD 3.0 is meant to be a low-risk upgrade, containing some minor breaking changes. For each change, the next
section will describe how to quickly determine if you are impacted, how to remediate the breaking change, and (if
applicable) how to opt out of the change.

Once 3.0 is released, no more 2.x minor versions will be released. We will continue to cut patch releases for the two
most recent minor versions (so 2.14 until 3.2 is released, and 2.13 until 3.1 is released).

## Breaking Changes

### Removed support for legacy repo config in argocd-cm

Before repositories were managed as Secrets, they were configured in the argocd-cm ConfigMap. The argocd-cm option has
been deprecated for some time and is no longer available in Argo CD 3.0.

#### Detection

To check whether you have any repositories configured in argocd-cm, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get cm argocd-cm -o=jsonpath="[{.data.repositories}, {.data['repository.credentials']}, {.data['helm.repositories']}]"
```

If you have no repositories configured in argocd-cm, the output will be `[, , ]`, and you are not impacted by this
change.

#### Resolution

To convert your repositories to Secrets, follow the documentation for 
[declarative management of repositories](../declarative-setup.md#repositories).
