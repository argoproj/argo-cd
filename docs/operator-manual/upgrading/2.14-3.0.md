# v2.14 to 3.0

Argo CD 3.0 is meant to be a low-risk upgrade containing only minor breaking changes. For each change, the next
section will describe how to quickly determine if you are impacted, how to remediate the breaking change, and (if
applicable) restore Argo CD 2.x default behavior.

Once 3.0 is released, no more 2.x minor versions will be released. We will continue to cut patch releases for the two
most recent minor versions (so 2.14 until 3.2 is released and 2.13 until 3.1 is released).

## Breaking Changes

### Fine-Grained RBAC for application `update` and `delete` sub-resources

The default behavior of fine-grained policies have changed so they no longer apply to sub-resources.
Prior to v3, policies granting `update` or `delete` to an application also applied to any of its sub-resources.

Starting with v3, the `update` or `delete` actions only apply to the application itself. New policies must be defined
to allow the `update/*` or `delete/*` actions on an Application's managed resources.

The v2 behavior can be preserved by setting the config value `server.rbac.disableApplicationFineGrainedRBACInheritance`
to `false` in the Argo CD ConfigMap `argocd-cm`.

Read the [RBAC documentation](../rbac.md#fine-grained-permissions-for-updatedelete-action) for more detailed
information.

### Logs RBAC enforcement as a first-class RBAC citizen

2.4 introduced `logs` as a new RBAC resource. In 2.3 and lower, users with `applications, get` access automatically got logs access. In 2.4, it became possible to enable logs RBAC enforcement with a flag in `argocd-cm` ConfigMap:

```yaml
server.rbac.log.enforce.enable: 'true'
```

Starting from 3.0, this flag is removed and the logs RBAC is enforced by default, meaning the `logs` tab on `pod` view will not be visible without granting explicit `logs, get` permissions to the users/groups/roles requiring it.

#### Detection

Users who have `server.rbac.log.enforce.enable: "true"` in their `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, are unaffected by this change.

Users who have `policy.default: role:readonly` or `policy.default: role:admin` in their `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap, are unaffected.

Users who don't have a `policy.default` in their `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap, and either have `server.rbac.log.enforce.enable` set to `false` or don't have this setting at all in their `argocd-cm` ConfigMap are affected and should perform the below remediation steps.

After the upgrade, it is recommended to remove the setting `server.rbac.log.enforce.enable` from `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, if it was there before the upgrade.

#### Remediation

##### Quick remediation (global change)

For users with an existing default policy with a custom role, add this policy to `policy.csv` for your custom role: `p, role:<YOUR_DEFAULT_ROLE>, logs, get, */*, allow`.
For users without a default policy, add this policy to `policy.csv`: `p, role:global-log-viewer, logs, get, */*, allow` and add the default policy for this role: `policy.default: role:global-log-viewer`

##### Recommended remediation (per-policy change)

Explicitly add a `logs, get` policy to every role that has a policy for `applications, get` or for `applications, *`.
This is the recommended way to maintain the principle of least privilege.
Similar to the way access to Applications are currently managed, access to logs can be either granted on a Project scope level (Project resource) or on the `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap level.
See this [example](../upgrading/2.3-2.4.md#example-1) for more details.

### Default `resource.exclusions` configurations

Argo CD manifest now contains a default configuration for `resource.exclusions` in the `argocd-cm` to exclude resources that
are known to be created by controllers and not usually managed in Git. The exclusions contain high volume and high churn objects
which we exclude for performance reasons, reducing connections and load to the K8s API servers of managed clusters.

The excluded Kinds are:

- **Kubernetes Resources**: `Endpoints`, `EndpointSlice`, `Lease`, `SelfSubjectReview`, `TokenReview`, `LocalSubjectAccessReview`, `SelfSubjectAccessReview`, `SelfSubjectRulesReview`, `SubjectAccessReview`, `CertificateSigningRequest`, `PolicyReport` and `ClusterPolicyReport`.
- **Cert Manager**: `CertificateRequest`.
- **Kyverno**: `EphemeralReport`, `ClusterEphemeralReport`, `AdmissionReport`, `ClusterAdmissionReport`, `BackgroundScanReport`, `ClusterBackgroundScanReport` and `UpdateRequest`.
- **Cilium**: `CiliumIdentity`, `CiliumEndpoint` and `CiliumEndpointSlice`.

The default `resource.exclusions` can be overridden or removed in the configMap to preserve the v2 behavior.

Read the [Declarative Setup](../declarative-setup.md) for more detailed information to configure `resource.exclusions`.

### Removal of `argocd_app_sync_status`, `argocd_app_health_status` and `argocd_app_created_time` Metrics

The `argocd_app_sync_status`, `argocd_app_health_status` and `argocd_app_created_time`, deprecated and disabled by
default since 1.5.0, have been removed. The information previously provided by these metrics is now available as labels
on the `argocd_app_info` metric.

#### Detection

Starting with 1.5.0, these metrics are only available if `ARGOCD_LEGACY_CONTROLLER_METRICS` is explicitly set to `true`.
If it is not set to true, you can safely upgrade with no changes.

#### Migration

If you are using these metrics, you will need to update your monitoring dashboards and alerts to use the new metric and
labels before upgrading.

### Changes to RBAC with Dex SSO Authentication

When using Dex, the `sub` claim returned in the authentication was used as the subject for RBAC. That value depends on
the Dex internal implementation and should not be considered an immutable value that represents the subject.

The new behavior will request the
`federated:id` [scope](https://dexidp.io/docs/configuration/custom-scopes-claims-clients/) from Dex, and the new value
used as the RBAC subject will be based
on the `federated_claims.user_id` claim instead of the `sub` claim.

If you were using the Dex sub claim in RBAC policies, you will need to update them to maintain the same access.

You can know the correct `user_id` to use by decoding the current `sub` claims defined in your policies. You can also
configure which
value is used as `user_id` for some [connectors](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/).

```sh
$> echo "ChdleGFtcGxlQGFyZ29wcm9qLmlvEgJkZXhfY29ubl9pZA" | base64 -d

example@argoproj.iodex_conn_i%
```

```yaml
# Policies based on the Dex sub claim (wrong)
- g, ChdleGFtcGxlQGFyZ29wcm9qLmlvEgJkZXhfY29ubl9pZA, role:example
- p, ChdleGFtcGxlQGFyZ29wcm9qLmlvEgJkZXhfY29ubl9pZA, applications, *, *, allow

# Policies now based on federated_claims.user_id claim (correct)
- g, example@argoproj.io, role:example
- p, example@argoproj.io, applications, *, *, allow
```

If authenticating with the CLI, make sure to use the new version as well to obtain an authentication token with the
appropriate claims.

### Removed support for legacy repo config in argocd-cm

Before repositories were managed as Secrets, they were configured in the argocd-cm ConfigMap. The argocd-cm option has
been deprecated for some time and is no longer available in Argo CD 3.0.

#### Detection

To check whether you have any repositories configured in argocd-cm, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get cm argocd-cm -o=jsonpath="[{.data.repositories}, {.data['repository\.credentials']}, {.data['helm\.repositories']}]"
```

If you have no repositories configured in argocd-cm, the output will be `[, , ]`, and you are not impacted by this
change.

#### Migration

To convert your repositories to Secrets, follow the documentation for
[declarative management of repositories](../declarative-setup.md#repositories).

### Ignoring ApplicationSet `applyNestedSelectors` field

Setting the `spec.applyNestedSelectors` field in an ApplicationSet resolves counter-intuitive behavior where filters in
nested selectors were not applied. Starting in Argo CD 3.0, the field is ignored, and behavior is always the same as if
`applyNestedSelectors` was set to `true`. In other words, nested selectors are always applied.

#### Detection

To detect if you are impacted, search your ApplicationSet controller logs for this string: `ignoring nested selector`.
If there are no logs with this string, you are not impacted.

Another way to detect if you are impacted is to run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get appsets -o=json | jq -r '.items[] | select(
    .spec.applyNestedSelectors != true and
    .spec.generators[][].generators[][].generators[].selector != null
  ) | .metadata.name'
```

The command will print the name of any ApplicationSet that has `applyNestedSelectors` unset or set to `false` and has
one or more nested selectors.

#### Remediation

Since `applyNestedSelectors` is false by default, you can safely remove the nested selectors on ApplicationSets where
`applyNestedSelectors` has not been explicitly set to `true`. After the selectors are removed, you can safely upgrade.

For example, you should remove the selector in this ApplicationSet before upgrading to Argo CD 3.0.

```diff
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: guestbook
spec:
  goTemplate: true
  goTemplateOptions: ["missingkey=error"]
  generators:
  - matrix:
      mergeKeys: ['test-key']
      generators:
      - list:
          elements:
          - test-key: 'test-value'
            cluster: staging
          - test-key: 'test-value'
            cluster: production
      - merge:
          generators:
          - list:
              elements:
              - another-key: 'another-value'
          - cluster: {}
-           selector:
-             matchLabels:
-               app: guestbook

  template:
    metadata:
      name: '{{.cluster}}-guestbook'
    spec:
      project: my-project
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/infra-team/cluster-deployments.git
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: guestbook/{{.cluster}}
      destination:
        server: '{{.url}}'
        namespace: guestbook
```

### Upgraded Helm version with breaking changes

Helm was upgraded to 3.17.1.
This may require changing your `values.yaml` files for subcharts, if the `values.yaml` contain a section with a `null` object.
See related issue in [Helm GitHub repository](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/12469)
See Helm 3.17.1 [release notes](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.17.1)
Example of such a [problem and resolution](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22035/files)
Explanation:

- Prior to Helm 3.17.1, `null` object in `values.yaml` resulted in a warning: `cannot overwrite table with non table` upon performing `helm template`, and the resulting K8s object was not overridden with the invalid `null` value.
- In Helm 3.17.1, this behavior changed and `null` object in `values.yaml` still results in this warning upon performing `helm template`, but the resulting K8s object will be overridden with the invalid `null` value.
- To resolve the issue, identify `values.yaml` with `null` object values, and remove those `null` values.

### Use Annotation-Based Tracking by Default

The default behavior for [tracking resources](../../user-guide/resource_tracking.md) has changed to use annotation-based
tracking instead of label-based tracking. Annotation-based tracking is more reliable and less prone to errors caused by
external code copying tracking labels from one resource to another.

#### Detection

To detect if you are impacted, check the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap for the `application.resourceTrackingMethod` field. If it
unset or is set to `label`, you are using label-based tracking. If it is set to `annotation`, you are already using
annotation-based tracking and are not impacted by this change.

```sh
kubectl get cm argocd-cm -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.data.application\.resourceTrackingMethod}'
```

#### Remediation

For most users, it is safe to upgrade to Argo CD 3.0 and use annotation-based tracking. Labels will be replaced with
annotations on the next sync. Applications will not be marked as out-of-sync if labels are not present on the
resources.

!!! warning "Potential for orphaned resources"

    There is a known edge case when switching from label-based tracking to annotation-based tracking that may cause
    resources to be orphaned. If the first sync operation after switching to annotation-based tracking includes a
    resource being deleted, Argo CD will fail to recognize that the resource is managed by the Application and will not
    delete it. To avoid this edge case, it is recommended to perform a sync operation on your Applications, even if
    they are not out of sync, so that orphan resource detection will work as expected on the next sync.

Some users rely on label-based tracking to track resources that are not managed by Argo CD. They may set annotations
to have Argo CD ignore the resource as extraneous or to disable pruning. If you are using label-based tracking to track
resources that are not managed by Argo CD, you will need to construct tracking annotations instead of tracking labels
and apply them to the relevant resources. The format of the tracking annotation is:

```yaml
argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id: <app name>:<resource group>/<resource kind>:<resource namespace>/<resource name>
```

For cluster-scoped resources, the namespace is set to the value in the Application's `spec.destination.namespace` field.

!!! warning

    Manually constructing and applying tracking labels and annotations is not an officially supported feature, and Argo
    CD's behavior may change in the future. It is recommended to manage resources with Argo CD via GitOps.

#### Opting Out

If you are not ready to use annotation-based tracking, you can opt out of this change by setting the
`application.resourceTrackingMethod` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap to `label`. There are no current plans to remove
label-based tracking.

## Other changes

### Using `cluster.inClusterEnabled: "false"`

When `cluster.inClusterEnabled: "false"` is explicitly configured, Applications currently configured to
sync on the in-cluster cluster will now be in an Unknown state, without the possibility to sync resources.

It will not be possible to create new Applications using the in-cluster cluster. When deleting existing
Application, it will not delete the previously managed resources.

It is recommended to perform any cleanup or migration to existing in-cluster Application before upgrading
when in-cluster is disabled. To perform cleanup post-migration, the in-cluster will need to be enabled temporarily.

### Ignoring all status updates and high churn mutations

Argo CD manifest now contains a default configuration for `resource.customizations.ignoreResourceUpdates` in the `argocd-cm`
to exclude common resources that are often mutated in Kubernetes. These mutations are known to cause an unnecessary
load on Argo CD. When a watched resource is modified, Argo CD will always ignore the `.status` changes.

The default `resource.customizations.ignoreResourceUpdates` configurations can be overridden or removed in the configMap to preserve the v2 behavior.

### Health status in the Application CR

The health status of each object used to be persisted under `/status` in the Application CR by default.
Any health churn in the resources deployed by the Application put load on the application controller.
Now, the health status is stored externally.

You can revert this behavior by setting the `controller.resource.health.persist` to `true` in the Argo CD
`argocd-cmd-params-cm.yaml` Config Map.

Example of a status field in the Application CR persisting health:

```yaml
status:
  health:
    status: Healthy
    lastTransitionTime: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  resources:
    - group: apps
      health:
        status: Healthy
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
      namespace: foo
      status: OutOfSync
      version: v1
  sync:
    status: OutOfSync
```

Example of a status field in the Application CR _not_ persisting health:

```yaml
status:
  health:
    status: Healthy
    lastTransitionTime: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'
  resourceHealthSource: appTree
  resources:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
      namespace: foo
      status: OutOfSync
      version: v1
  sync:
    status: OutOfSync
```

#### Detection

1. Check the `argocd-cmd-params-cm.yaml` ConfigMap for `controller.resource.health.persist`.

   If the value is empty or true, the health status is persisted in the Application CR.

```sh
kubectl get cm argocd-cmd-params-cm -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.data.controller\.resource\.health\.persist}'
```

2. Check any Application CR for the `resourceHealthSource` field.
   If you see a blank value, the health status is persisted in the Application CR.

```sh
kubectl get applications.argoproj.io <my app> -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.status.resourceHealthSource}'
```

#### Migration

Any tools or CLI commands parsing the `.status.resources[].health` need to be updated to use the argocd cli/API to get the health status.

!!! note
    The application list API (argocd app list) no longer returns the individual health status of resources.

```sh
argocd app get <my app> -o json
```

### Empty Environment Variables in Plugins

In Argo CD 3.0, empty environment variables are now passed to config management plugins.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
spec:
  source:
    plugin:
      name: example-plugin
      env:
        - name: VERSION
          value: '1.2.3'
        - name: DATA # Even though this is empty, it will be passed to the plugin as ARGOCD_ENV_DATA="".
          value: ''
```

### Ignoring resource updates configured in `ignoreDifferences` by default

By default, the existing system-level `ignoreDifferences` customizations will be added to ignore resource updates as well.

Logically, if differences to a field are configured to be ignored, there is no reason to generate the diff for the application
when that field changes.

To disable this behavior and preserve the v2 default, the `ignoreDifferencesOnResourceUpdates` can be set to false:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  resource.compareoptions: |
    ignoreDifferencesOnResourceUpdates: false
```

More details for ignored resource updates in the [Reconcile Optimization](../reconcile.md) documentation.

### Ignoring status field from differences by default

By default, the compare options to ignore the status field has been changed from `crd` to `all` resources.

This means that differences won't be detected anymore for fields that are part of the status.

If you rely on the status field being part of your desired state, the `ignoreResourceStatusField` setting can be used to preserve the v2 default.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  resource.compareoptions: |
    ignoreResourceStatusField: crd
```

### Removing default ignores of `preserveUnknownFields` for CRD

The `spec.preserveUnknownFields` has been deprecated in favor of `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` in the CRD v1.

This means that CRD deployed with Argo CD containing `spec.preserveUnknownFields: false` will be out of sync. To address this problem,
the `preserveUnknownFields` field can be removed from the CRD spec.

Until this is completed, if you want your Application not to be out of sync, you can add the following configuration to the Application manifest.

```yaml
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apiextensions.k8s.io
      kind: CustomResourceDefinition
      jsonPointers:
        - /spec/preserveUnknownFields
```

You can also configure it globally in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap.

```yaml
resource.customizations.ignoreDifferences.apiextensions.k8s.io_CustomResourceDefinition: |
    jsonPointers:
    - /spec/preserveUnknownFields
```

More details for ignored resource updates in the [Diffing customization](../../user-guide/diffing.md) documentation.
