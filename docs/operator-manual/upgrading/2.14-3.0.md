# v2.14 to 3.0

Argo CD 3.0 is meant to be a low-risk upgrade, containing some minor breaking changes. For each change, the next
section will describe how to quickly determine if you are impacted, how to remediate the breaking change, and (if
applicable) how to opt out of the change.

Once 3.0 is released, no more 2.x minor versions will be released. We will continue to cut patch releases for the two
most recent minor versions (so 2.14 until 3.2 is released, and 2.13 until 3.1 is released).

## Breaking Changes

### Fine-Grained RBAC for application `update` and `delete` sub-resources

The default behavior of fine-grained policies have changed so they do not apply to sub-resources anymore.
Prior to v3, when `update` or `delete` actions were allowed on an application, it gave the permission to
update and delete the application itself and any of its sub-resources.

Starting with v3, the `update` or `delete` actions only apply on the application. New policies must be defined
to allow the `update/*` or `delete/*` actions on the application to give permissions on sub-resources.

The v2 behavior can be preserved by setting the config value `server.rbac.disableApplicationFineGrainedRBACInheritance`
to `false` in the Argo CD ConfigMap `argocd-cm`.

Read the [RBAC documentation](../rbac.md#fine-grained-permissions-for-updatedelete-action) for more detailed inforamtion.

## Other changes

### Using `cluster.inClusterEnabled: "false"`

When `cluster.inClusterEnabled: "false"` is explicitly configured, Applications currently configured to
sync on the in-cluster cluster will now be in an Unknown state, without the possibility to sync resources.

It will not be possible to create new Applications using the in-cluster cluster. When deleting existing
Application, it will not delete the previously managed resources.

It is recommended to perform any cleanup or migration to existing in-cluster Application before upgrading
when in-cluster is disabled. To perform cleanup post-migration, the in-cluster will need to be enabled temporarily.
