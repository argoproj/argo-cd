# v2.x to 3.0

Argo CD 3.0 introduces **low-impact breaking changes**. We do not expect these changes to be a significant concern for
the majority of users. For each breaking change, we document here 1) an easy way to determine whether you are affected
and 2) how to migrate.

Once Argo CD 3.0 is released, there will be no new minor releases in the 2.x series. We will continue to provide patch
releases for the 2.x series until they reach EOL.

## New library version

If you use Argo CD code as a library in a go project, you should update your go.mod file to reflect the new version.

```diff
require (
-    github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2 v2.13.2
+    github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v3 v3.0.0
)
```
