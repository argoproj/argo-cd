# v1.3 to 1.4

## Sync Hooks

The Argo CD deletes all **in-flight** hooks if you terminate running sync operation. The hook state assessment change implemented in this release the Argo CD enables detection of 
an in-flight state for all Kubernetes resources including `Deployment`, `PVC`, `StatefulSet`, `ReplicaSet` etc. So if you terminate the sync operation that has, for example,
`StatefulSet` hook that is `Progressing` it will be deleted. The long-running jobs are not supposed to be used as a sync hook and you should consider using
[Sync Waves](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/) instead.
 
From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).

# API Changes
