# v2.7 to 2.8

## Tini as entrypoint

With the 2.8 release `entrypoint.sh` will be removed from the containers,
because starting with 2.7, the implicit entrypoint is set to `tini` in the
`Dockerfile` explicitly, and the kubernetes manifests has been updated to use
it. Simply updating the containers without updating the deployment manifests
will result in pod startup failures, as the old manifests are relying on
`entrypoint.sh` instead of `tini`. Please make sure the manifests are updated
properly before moving to 2.8.

## Filtering applied to cluster `List` API endpoint

Prior to `v2.8`, the `List` endpoint on the `ClusterService` did **not** filter
clusters when responding, despite accepting query parameters. This bug has
been addressed, and query parameters are now taken into account to filter the
resulting list of clusters.

## Don't merge on absent mergeKey

Previously, the merge generator in an ApplicationSet merges values even if the
set mergeKeys where absent in the first child generator. Every subsequent
generator producing an empty value for the mergeKey would be merged in as if
the labels exist and match. As soon as the label starts existing in the first
generator, none of the previously merged values would now be merged as the
merge key differs now. The behavior was `!exist OR (exist AND match)`.
This is considered a bug and has been changed. Parameter sets are only merged
if they `exist and match` in the base generator now leading to a more
predictable behavior.
