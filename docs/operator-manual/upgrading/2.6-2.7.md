# v2.6 to 2.7

## Configure RBAC to account for new `extensions` resource

2.7 introduces the new [Proxy Extensions][1] feature with a new `extensions`
[RBAC resource][2].

When you upgrade to 2.7, RBAC policies with `*` in the *resource*
field and `*` in the action field, it will automatically grant the
`extensions` privilege.

The Proxy Extension feature is disabled by default, however it is
recommended to check your RBAC configurations to enforce the least
necessary privileges.

Example
Old:

```csv
p, role:org-admin, *, *, *, allow
```

New:

```csv
p, role:org-admin, clusters, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, projects, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, applications, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, repositories, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, certificates, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, accounts, create, my-proj/*, allow
p, role:org-admin, gpgkeys, create, my-proj/*, allow
# If you don't want to grant the new permission, don't include the following line
p, role:org-admin, extensions, invoke, my-proj/*, allow
```
