# v2.5 to 2.6

## ApplicationSets: `^` behavior change in Sprig's semver functions
Argo CD 2.5 introduced [Go templating in ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/GoTemplate/). Go templates have access to the Sprig function library.

Argo CD 2.6 upgrades Sprig to v3. That upgrade includes an upgrade of [Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases) to v3.

Masterminds/semver v3 changed the behavior of the `^` prefix in semantic version constraints. If you are using Go-templated ApplicationSets which include references to [Sprig's semver functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/semver.html) and use the `^` prefix, read the [Masterminds/semver changelog](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases/tag/v3.0.0) to understand how your ApplicationSets' behavior may change.
