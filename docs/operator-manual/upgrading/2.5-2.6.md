# v2.5 to 2.6

## ApplicationSets: `^` behavior change in Sprig's semver functions
Argo CD 2.5 introduced [Go templating in ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/GoTemplate/). Go templates have access to the Sprig function library.

Argo CD 2.6 upgrades Sprig to v3. That upgrade includes an upgrade of [Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases) to v3.

Masterminds/semver v3 changed the behavior of the `^` prefix in semantic version constraints. If you are using Go-templated ApplicationSets which include references to [Sprig's semver functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/semver.html) and use the `^` prefix, read the [Masterminds/semver changelog](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases/tag/v3.0.0) to understand how your ApplicationSets' behavior may change.

## Removal of argocd-cm plugin support delayed until 2.7

Support for argocd-cm plugins was previously scheduled for 2.6. At the time, sidecar plugins could not be specified by
name. Argo CD v2.6 introduces support for specifying sidecar plugins by name. 

Removal of argocd-cm plugin support has been delayed until 2.7 to provide a transition time for users who need to 
specify plugins by name.
