# v2.5 to 2.6

## ApplicationSets: `^` behavior change in Sprig's semver functions
Argo CD 2.5 introduced [Go templating in ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/GoTemplate/). Go templates have access to the Sprig function library.

Argo CD 2.6 upgrades Sprig to v3. That upgrade includes an upgrade of [Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases) to v3.

Masterminds/semver v3 changed the behavior of the `^` prefix in semantic version constraints. If you are using Go-templated ApplicationSets which include references to [Sprig's semver functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/semver.html) and use the `^` prefix, read the [Masterminds/semver changelog](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases/tag/v3.0.0) to understand how your ApplicationSets' behavior may change.

## Applications with suspended jobs now marked "Suspended" instead of "Progressing"
Prior to Argo CD v2.6, an Application managing a suspended Job would be marked as "Progressing". This was confusing/unexpected behavior for many. Starting with v2.6, Argo CD will mark such Applications as "Suspended".

If you have processes which rely on the previous behavior (for example, a CI job with an argocd app wait call), update those before upgrading to v2.6.

## The API Server now requires tokens to include the `aud` claim by default

Argo CD v2.6 now requires that the `aud` claim be present in the token used to authenticate to the API Server. This is a 
security improvement, as it prevents tokens from being used against the API Server which were not intended for it.

If you rely on an OIDC provider which does not provide a `aud` claim, you can disable this requirement by setting the 
`skipAudienceCheckWhenTokenHasNoAudience` flag to `true` in your Argo CD OIDC configuration. (See the 
[OIDC configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#existing-oidc-provider)
for an example.)
