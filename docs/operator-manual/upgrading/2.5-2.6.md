# v2.5 to 2.6

## Removed client-side manifest diffs

When using `argocd app diff --local`, code from the repo server used to run on the user's machine in order to locally generate manifests for comparing against the live manifests of an app.

v2.5 introduced the `--server-side-generate` argument and deprecated client-side local diffing. `--server-side-generate` is now the default, and client-side diffing is removed. 

`argocd app diff --local repoDir` now uploads the contents of `repoDir` to the repo server and runs your manifest generation pipeline against it, the same as it would for a Git repo.

!!! warning
    The semantics of *where* Argo will start generating manifests within a repo has changed between client-side and server-side generation. With client-side generation, the application's path (`spec.source.path`) was ignored and the value of `--local-repo-root` was effectively used (by default `/` relative to `--local`).

    For example, given an application that has an application path of `/manifests`, you would have had to run `argocd app diff --local yourRepo/manifests`. This behavior did not match the repo server's process of downloading the full repo/chart and then beginning generation in the path specified in the application manifest.

    When switching to server-side generation, `--local` should point to the root of your repo *without* including your `spec.source.path`.

## ApplicationSets: `^` behavior change in Sprig's semver functions
Argo CD 2.5 introduced [Go templating in ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/GoTemplate/). Go templates have access to the Sprig function library.

Argo CD 2.6 upgrades Sprig to v3. That upgrade includes an upgrade of [Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases) to v3.

Masterminds/semver v3 changed the behavior of the `^` prefix in semantic version constraints. If you are using Go-templated ApplicationSets which include references to [Sprig's semver functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/semver.html) and use the `^` prefix, read the [Masterminds/semver changelog](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/releases/tag/v3.0.0) to understand how your ApplicationSets' behavior may change.
