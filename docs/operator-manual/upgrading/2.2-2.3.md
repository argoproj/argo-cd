# v2.2 to 2.3

## Configure Additional ArgoCD Binaries

We have removed non-Linux ArgoCD binaries (Darwin amd64 and Windows amd64) from the image ([#7668](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/7668)) and the associated download buttons in the help page in the UI.

Those removed binaries will still be included in the release assets and we made those configurable in [#7755](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/7755). You can add download buttons for other OS architectures by adding the following to your `argocd-cm` ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  help.download.linux-arm64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.darwin-amd64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.darwin-arm64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.windows-amd64: "path-or-url-to-download"
```
