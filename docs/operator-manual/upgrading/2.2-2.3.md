# v2.2 to 2.3

## Argo CD Notifications and ApplicationSet Are Bundled into Argo CD

The Argo CD Notifications and ApplicationSet are part of Argo CD now. You no longer need to install them separately.
The Notifications and ApplicationSet components are bundled into default Argo CD installation manifests.

The bundled manifests are drop-in replacements for the previous versions. If you are using Kustomize to bundle the manifests together then just
remove references to https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-notifications and https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset. No action is required
if you are using `kubectl apply`.

## Configure Additional ArgoCD Binaries

We have removed non-Linux ArgoCD binaries (Darwin amd64 and Windows amd64) from the image ([#7668](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/7668)) and the associated download buttons in the help page in the UI.

Those removed binaries will still be included in the release assets and we made those configurable in [#7755](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/7755). You can add download buttons for other OS architectures by adding the following to your `argocd-cm` ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  help.download.linux-arm64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.darwin-amd64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.darwin-arm64: "path-or-url-to-download"
  help.download.windows-amd64: "path-or-url-to-download"
```
