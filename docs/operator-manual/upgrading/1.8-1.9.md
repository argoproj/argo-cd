# v1.8 to 1.9

## Environment variables expansion

Argo CD supports using [environment variables](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/build-environment/) in
config management tools parameters. The expansion logic has been improved and now expands missing environment variables
into an empty string.

## Docker image migrated to use Ubuntu as base

The official Docker image has been migrated to use `ubuntu:20.10` instead of
`debian:10-slim` as base image. While this should not affect user experience,
you might be affected if you use custom-built images and/or include third party
tools in custom-built images.

Please make sure that your custom tools are still working with the update to
v1.9 before deploying it onto production.
