# v3.0 to 3.1

## Symlink protection in API `--staticassets` directory

The `--staticassets` directory in the API server (`/app/shared` by default) is now protected against out-of-bounds 
symlinks. This is to help protect against symlink attacks. If you have any symlinks in your `--staticassets` directory
to a location outside the directory, they will return a 500 error starting with 3.1.
