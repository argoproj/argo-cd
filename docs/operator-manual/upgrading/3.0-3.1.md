# v3.0 to 3.1

## Symlink protection in API `--staticassets` directory

The `--staticassets` directory in the API server (`/app/shared` by default) is now protected against out-of-bounds 
symlinks. This is to help protect against symlink attacks. If you have any symlinks in your `--staticassets` directory
to a location outside the directory, they will return a 500 error starting with 3.1.

## Breaking Changes

### Kube versions

Until v3.0, Argo CD removed `+` identifier from `kubeVersions` in Helm, Kustomize and Plugins. For example, if Argo CD receive `kubeVersions` as vX.Y.Z+, we convert to vX.Y.Z internally. After v3.0, the internal conversation is entirely removed.

#### Detection

To detect if you are affected, check the `kubeVersions` you'are using. If you use `kubeVersions` including `+` identifier, the application must be failed when you upgrade from v3.0 to v3.1.

#### Remediation

This problem is that Argo CD removes no longer `+` identifier from `kubeVersions. Your application has already used `kubeVersions` triming `+` identifier, so it just works correctlly by removing `+` identifier.
