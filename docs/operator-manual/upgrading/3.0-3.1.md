# v3.0 to 3.1

Argo CD 3.1 contains a few fixes that could not be included in 3.0.


## Override Action redefined to include more cases
Up to now, the `override` action when syncing was only concerned about syncing arbitrary local manifests. If the `override` right is granted to a user, they can 'sync' the application to arbitrary manifests or different revisions to existing Applications, e.g. for development or testing purposes. 
From now on, syncing with a Revision (or Revisions) passed with the sync Request is also considered to be an `override`, since both methods allow to completely change/delete the deployed resources of the Application, diverging from the Application Manifest. 

The behaviour can be toggled by setting `application.sync.externalRevisionConsideredOverride` in the argocd-cm Configmap.
By default, this value is set to `false` in order to not be a breaking change, but it is highly advised to set this flag to `true`.
Future Versions will probably set the default to `true`. See [RBAC Documentation](../rbac.md#the-override-action)


## Symlink protection in API `--staticassets` directory

The `--staticassets` directory in the API server (`/app/shared` by default) is now protected against out-of-bounds 
symlinks. This is to help protect against symlink attacks. If you have any symlinks in your `--staticassets` directory
to a location outside the directory, they will return a 500 error starting with 3.1.
