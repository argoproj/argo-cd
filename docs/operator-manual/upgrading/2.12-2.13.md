## Upgraded Dex Version

Dex [v2.39.0](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/tag/v2.39.0) included a breaking change for the LDAP connector:

> The validation of username and password in the LDAP connector is much more strict now.
> As of today, Dex uses the EscapeFilter function to check for special characters in credentials and prevent injections by denying such requests.

## Updated Job name for manually started CronJob jobs

The naming of Jobs that are manually started from CronJobs (using Argo CD) was changed. Instead of the previous postfix `-YYYYMMDDHHmm` (4-digit year), manually started Jobs now receive postfix `-YYMMDDHHmm` (2-digit year).

The format of Jobs that are started from a CronJob on schedule (by Kubernetes) is not handled by Argo CD and remains unchanged.
