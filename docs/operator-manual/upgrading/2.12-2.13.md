# v2.12 to 2.13

## Upgraded Dex Version

Dex [v2.39.0](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/tag/v2.39.0) included a breaking change for the LDAP connector:

> The validation of username and password in the LDAP connector is much more strict now.
> As of today, Dex uses the EscapeFilter function to check for special characters in credentials and prevent injections by denying such requests.
