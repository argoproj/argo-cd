# v2.1 to 2.2

## Upgraded Helm Version

Note that bundled Helm has been upgraded from 3.6.0 to v3.7+. This includes following breaking changes:

- Repository credentials are no longer passed to download charts that
  are being served from a different domain than the repository.

  You can still force older behavior with `--helm-pass-credentials` option to `argocd app create`.

  More information in the [Helm v3.6.1 release notes](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.6.1).

- Experimental OCI support has been rewritten.

  More information in the [Helm v3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.7.0).
