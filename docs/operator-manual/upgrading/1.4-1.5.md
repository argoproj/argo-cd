## Updated prometheus metrics

The `argocd_app_sync_status`, `argocd_app_health_status` and `argocd_app_created_time` prometheus metrics are deprecated
in favor of additional labels to `argocd_app_info` metric. The deprecated labels are still available can be re-enabled
using `ARGOCD_LEGACY_CONTROLLER_METRICS=true` environment variable. The legacy example Grafana dashboard is available at
[examples/dashboard-legacy.json](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/examples/dashboard-legacy.json). 

## Redis HA Proxy

!!! warning
    Manual intervention might be required to complete the upgrade.

High-availability (HA) Argo CD manifests now bundles Redis in HA Proxy in front of it. Following issue have been
observed during the upgrade:

* you might see intermittent login failures;
* after upgrade is completed ha proxy might be unable to access redis server
(see [argo-cd#3547](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/3547), [DandyDeveloper/charts#26](https://github.com/DandyDeveloper/charts/issues/26)).
As workaround "restart" `argocd-redis-ha-haproxy` Deployment and `argocd-redis-ha-server` StatefulSet.   

## Upgraded Kustomize Version

Note that bundled Kustomize has been upgraded to v3.6.1.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
