# v2.13 to 2.14

## Avoid v2.14.0 manifests and use v2.14.1

The tagged v2.14.0 manifests contain a nonexistent Argo CD image. If you are using the Argo CD manifests as a remote
base, use the v2.14.1 manifests instead.

Eg, `https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/manifests/ha/cluster-install?ref=v2.14.1` or
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.14.1/manifests/install.yaml`

## Upgraded Helm Version

Helm was upgraded to 3.16.2 and the skipSchemaValidation Flag was added to
the [CLI and Application CR](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation). 

## Breaking Changes

## Sanitized project API response

Due to security reasons ([GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff)),
the project API response was sanitized to remove sensitive information. This includes
credentials of project-scoped repositories and clusters.
