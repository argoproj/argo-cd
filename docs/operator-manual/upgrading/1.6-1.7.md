# v1.6 to 1.7

## AppProject tokens moved to status field

In order to address [argoproj/argo-cd#2718](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/2718) the JWT tokens stored in
AppProject CRD have been moved from `spec` to `status` field. The migration is performed automatically during upgrade
and might cause few seconds delay. No additional side effects besides the delay are expected. It is acceptable to
rollback to previous version - no data loss is expected.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
