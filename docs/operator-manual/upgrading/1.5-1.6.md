# v1.5 to 1.6

## Removed Deprecated Field of /managed-resources API

The deprecated `diff` field had been removed from `/api/v1/applications/<app-name>/managed-resources` API. The field is not used
by Argo CD CLI or UI, so it might affect you only if you programmatically use the `managed-resources` API.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
