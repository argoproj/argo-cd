# v2.0 to 2.1

## Upgraded Kustomize Version

Note that bundled Kustomize has been upgraded to v4.1.2. Some of the flags are changed in Kustomize V4. 
For example flag name `load_restrictor` is changed in Kustomize v4+. It is changed from `--load_restrictor=none` to `--load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone`. 

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./overview.md).
