# Integrating Keycloak and ArgoCD

These instructions will take you through the entire process of getting your ArgoCD application authenticating with Keycloak. 
You will create a client within Keycloak and configure ArgoCD to use Keycloak for authentication, using groups set in Keycloak
to determine privileges in Argo.

## Creating a new client in Keycloak

First we need to setup a new client. Start by logging into your keycloak server, select the realm you want to use (`master` by default)
and then go to __Clients__ and click the __Create client__ button at the top.

![Keycloak add client](../../assets/keycloak-add-client.png "Keycloak add client")

Enable the __Client authentication__.

![Keycloak add client Step 2](../../assets/keycloak-add-client_2.png "Keycloak add client Step 2")

Configure the client by setting the __Root URL__, __Web origins__, __Admin URL__ to the hostname (https://{hostname}).

Also you can set __Home URL__ to your _/applications_ path and __Valid Post logout redirect URIs__ to "+".

The Valid Redirect URIs should be set to https://{hostname}/auth/callback (you can also set the less secure https://{hostname}/* for testing/development purposes,
but it's not recommended in production).

![Keycloak configure client](../../assets/keycloak-configure-client.png "Keycloak configure client")

Make sure to click __Save__. There should be a tab called __Credentials__. You can copy the Secret that we'll use in our ArgoCD 
configuration.

## Configuring the groups claim

In order for ArgoCD to provide the groups the user is in we need to configure a groups claim that can be included in the authentication token.
To do this we'll start by creating a new __Client Scope__ called _groups_.

![Keycloak add scope](../../assets/keycloak-add-scope.png "Keycloak add scope")

Once you've created the client scope you can now add a Token Mapper which will add the groups claim to the token when the client requests
the groups scope. In the Tab "Mappers", click on "Configure a new mapper" and choose __Group Membership__.
Make sure to set the __Name__ as well as the __Token Claim Name__ to _groups_. Also disable the "Full group path".

![Keycloak groups mapper](../../assets/keycloak-groups-mapper.png "Keycloak groups mapper")

We can now configure the client to provide the _groups_ scope. Go back to the client we've created earlier and go to the Tab "Client Scopes".
Click on "Add client scope", choose the _groups_ scope and add it either to the __Default__ or to the __Optional__ Client Scope. If you put it in the Optional
category you will need to make sure that ArgoCD requests the scope in its OIDC configuration. Since we will always want group information, I recommend
using the Default category.

![Keycloak client scope](../../assets/keycloak-client-scope.png "Keycloak client scope")

Create a group called _ArgoCDAdmins_ and have your current user join the group.

![Keycloak user group](../../assets/keycloak-user-group.png "Keycloak user group")

## Configuring ArgoCD OIDC

Let's start by storing the client secret you generated earlier in the argocd secret _argocd-secret_.

1. First you'll need to encode the client secret in base64: `$ echo -n '83083958-8ec6-47b0-a411-a8c55381fbd2' | base64`
2. Then you can edit the secret and add the base64 value to a new key called _oidc.keycloak.clientSecret_ using `$ kubectl edit secret argocd-secret`.
   
Your Secret should look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: argocd-secret
data:
  ...
  oidc.keycloak.clientSecret: ODMwODM5NTgtOGVjNi00N2IwLWE0MTEtYThjNTUzODFmYmQy   
  ...
```

Now we can configure the config map and add the oidc configuration to enable our keycloak authentication.
You can use `$ kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm`.

Your ConfigMap should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  url: https://argocd.example.com
  oidc.config: |
    name: Keycloak
    issuer: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master
    clientID: argocd
    clientSecret: $oidc.keycloak.clientSecret
    requestedScopes: ["openid", "profile", "email", "groups"]
```

Make sure that:

- __issuer__ ends with the correct realm (in this example _master_)
- __issuer__ on Keycloak releases older than version 17 the URL must include /auth (in this example /auth/realms/master)
- __clientID__ is set to the Client ID you configured in Keycloak
- __clientSecret__ points to the right key you created in the _argocd-secret_ Secret
- __requestedScopes__ contains the _groups_ claim if you didn't add it to the Default scopes

##Â Configuring ArgoCD Policy

Now that we have an authentication that provides groups we want to apply a policy to these groups.
We can modify the _argocd-rbac-cm_ ConfigMap using `$ kubectl edit configmap argocd-rbac-cm`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
data:
  policy.csv: |
    g, ArgoCDAdmins, role:admin
```

In this example we give the role _role:admin_ to all users in the group _ArgoCDAdmins_.

## Login

You can now login using our new Keycloak OIDC authentication:
