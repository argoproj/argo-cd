# High Availability

A set HA of manifests are provided for users who wish to run Argo CD in a highly available manner.

[Manifests â§‰](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/manifests) 

!!! note
    The HA installation will require at least three different nodes due to pod anti-affinity roles in the specs.
