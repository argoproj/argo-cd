# Changelog

## v0.9.1 (2018-09-24)

- Repo server unable to execute ls-remote for private repos (issue #639)

## v0.9.0 (2018-09-24)

### Notes about upgrading from v0.8
* Cluster wide resources should be allowed in default project (due to issue #330):

```
argocd project allow-cluster-resource default '*' '*'
```

* Projects now provide the ability to allow or deny deployments of cluster-scoped resources
(e.g. Namespaces, ClusterRoles, CustomResourceDefinitions). When upgrading from v0.8 to v0.9, to
match the behavior of v0.8 (which did not have restrictions on deploying resources) and continue to
allow deployment of cluster-scoped resources, an additional command should be run:

```bash
argocd proj allow-cluster-resource default '*' '*'
```

The above command allows the `default` project to deploy any cluster-scoped resources which matches
the behavior of v0.8.

* The secret keys in the argocd-secret containing the TLS certificate and key, has been renamed from
  `server.crt` and `server.key` to the standard `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys. This enables ArgoCD
  to integrate better with Ingress and cert-manager. When upgrading to v0.9, the `server.crt` and
  `server.key` keys in argocd-secret should be renamed to the new keys.

### Notes about upgrading from v0.7
* The RBAC model has been improved to support explicit denies. What this means is that any previous
RBAC policy rules, need to be rewritten to include one extra column with the effect:
`allow` or `deny`. For example, if a rule was written like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*
    ```
    It should be rewritten to look like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*, allow
    ```

### Changes since v0.7:
+ Support kustomize as an application source (issue #510)
