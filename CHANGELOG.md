## v1.0.0 (2019-05-16)

### New Features

#### Network View

A new way to visual application resources had been introduced to the Application Details page. The Network View visualizes connections between Ingresses, Services and Pods
based on ingress reference service, service's label selectors and labels. The new view is useful to understand the application traffic flow and troubleshot connectivity issues.

#### Custom Actions

Argo CD introduces Custom Resource Actions to allow users to provide their own Lua scripts to modify existing Kubernetes resources in their applications. These actions are exposed in the UI to allow easy, safe, and reliable changes to their resources.  This functionality can be used to introduce functionality such as suspending and enabling a Kubernetes cronjob, continue a BlueGreen deployment with Argo Rollouts, or scaling a deployment. 

#### UI Enhancements & Usability Enhancements

* New color palette intended to highlight unhealthily and out-of-sync resources more clearly.
* The health of more resources is displayed, so it easier to quickly zoom to unhealthy pods, replica-sets, etc.
* Resources that do not have health no longer appear to be healthy. 
* Support for configuring Git repo credentials at a domain/org level
* Support for configuring requested OIDC provider scopes and enforced RBAC scopes
* Support for configuring monitored resources whitelist in addition to excluded resources

## v0.12.0 (2019-03-20)

### New Features

#### Improved UI

Many improvements to the UI were made, including:

* Table view when viewing applications
* Filters on applications
* Table view when viewing application resources
* YAML editor in UI
* Switch to text-based diff instead of json diff
* Ability to edit application specs

#### Custom Health Assessments (CRD Health)

Argo CD has long been able to perform health assessments on resources, however this could only
assess the health for a few native kubernetes types (deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, etc...).
Now, Argo CD can be extended to gain understanding of any CRD health, in the form of Lua scripts.
For example, using this feature, Argo CD now understands the CertManager Certificate CRD and will
report a Degraded status when there are issues with the cert.

#### Configuration Management Plugins

Argo CD introduces Config Management Plugins to support custom configuration management tools other
than the set that Argo CD provides out-of-the-box (Helm, Kustomize, Ksonnet, Jsonnet). Using config
management plugins, Argo CD can be configured to run specified commands to render manifests. This
makes it possible for Argo CD to support other config management tools (kubecfg, kapitan, shell
scripts, etc...).

#### High Availability

Argo CD is now fully HA. A set HA of manifests are provided for users who wish to run Argo CD in
a highly available manner. NOTE: The HA installation will require at least three different nodes due
to pod anti-affinity roles in the specs.

#### Improved Application Source

* Support for Kustomize 2
* YAML/JSON/Jsonnet Directories can now be recursed
* Support for Jsonnet external variables and top-level arguments

#### Additional Prometheus Metrics

Argo CD provides the following additional prometheus metrics:
* Sync counter to track sync activity and results over time
* Application reconciliation (refresh) performance to track Argo CD performance and controller activity
* Argo CD API Server metrics for monitoring HTTP/gRPC requests

#### Fuzzy Diff Logic

Argo CD can now be configured to ignore known differences for resource types by specifying a json
pointer to the field path to ignore. This helps prevent OutOfSync conditions when a user has no
control over the manifests. Ignored differences can be configured either at an application level, 
or a system level, based on a group/kind.

#### Resource Exclusions

Argo CD can now be configured to completely ignore entire classes of resources group/kinds.
Excluding high-volume resources improves performance and memory usage, and reduces load and
bandwidth to the Kubernetes API server. It also allows users to fine-tune the permissions that
Argo CD needs to a cluster by preventing Argo CD from attempting to watch resources of that
group/kind.

#### gRPC-Web Support

The argocd CLI can be now configured to communicate to the Argo CD API server using gRPC-Web
(HTTP1.1) using a new CLI flag `--grpc-web`. This resolves some compatibility issues users were
experiencing with ingresses and gRPC (HTTP2), and should enable argocd CLI to work with virtually
any load balancer, ingress controller, or API gateway.

#### CLI features

Argo CD introduces some additional CLI commands:

* `argocd app edit APPNAME` - to edit an application spec using preferred EDITOR
* `argocd proj edit PROJNAME` - to edit an project spec using preferred EDITOR
* `argocd app patch APPNAME` - to patch an application spec
* `argocd app patch-resource APPNAME` - to patch a specific resource which is part of an application


### Breaking Changes

#### Label selector changes, dex-server rename

The label selectors for deployments were been renamed to use kubernetes common labels
(`app.kuberentes.io/name=NAME` instead of `app=NAME`). Since K8s deployment label selectors are
immutable, during an upgrade from v0.11 to v0.12, the old deployments should be deleted using
`--cascade=false` which allows the new deployments to be created without introducing downtime.
Once the new deployments are ready, the older replicasets can be deleted. Use the following
instructions to upgrade from v0.11 to v0.12 without introducing downtime:

```
# delete the deployments with cascade=false. this orphan the replicasets, but leaves the pods running
kubectl delete deploy --cascade=false argocd-server argocd-repo-server argocd-application-controller

# apply the new manifests and wait for them to finish rolling out
kubectl apply <new install manifests>
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-application-controller
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-repo-server
kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-application-controller

# delete old replicasets which are using the legacy label
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-server
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-repo-server
kubectl delete rs -l app=argocd-application-controller

# delete the legacy dex-server which was renamed
kubectl delete deploy dex-server
```

#### Deprecation of spec.source.componentParameterOverrides

For declarative application specs, the `spec.source.componentParameterOverrides` field is now
deprecated in favor of application source specific config. They are replaced with new fields
specific to their respective config management. For example, a Helm application spec using the
legacy field:

```yaml
spec:
  source:
    componentParameterOverrides:
    - name: image.tag
      value: v1.2
```

should move to:

```yaml
spec:
  source:
    helm:
      parameters:
      - name: image.tag
        value: v1.2
```

Argo CD will automatically duplicate the legacy field values to the new locations (and vice versa)
as part of automatic migration. The legacy `spec.source.componentParameterOverrides` field will be
kept around for the v0.12 release (for migration purposes) and will be removed in the next Argo CD
release.

#### Removal of spec.source.environment and spec.source.valuesFiles

The `spec.source.environment` and `spec.source.valuesFiles` fields, which were deprecated in v0.11,
are now completely removed from the Application spec.


#### API/CLI compatibility

Due to API spec changes related to the deprecation of componentParameterOverrides, Argo CD v0.12
has a minimum client version of v0.12.0. Older CLI clients will be rejected.

## v0.11.0 (2019-01-10)
This is Argo CD's biggest release ever and introduces a completely redesigned controller architecture.

### New Features

#### Performance & Scalability
The application controller has a completely redesigned architecture which improved performance and
scalability during application reconciliation.

This was achieved by introducing an in-memory, live state cache of lightweight Kubernetes object 
metadata. During reconciliation, the controller no longer performs expensive, in-line queries of app
related resources in K8s API server, instead relying on the metadata available in the live state 
cache. This dramatically improves performance and responsiveness, and is less burdensome to the K8s
API server.

#### Object relationship visualization forÂ CRDs
With the new controller design, Argo CD is now able to understand ownership relationship between
*all* Kubernetes objects, not just the built-in types. This enables Argo CD to visualize
parent/child relationships between all kubernetes objects, including CRDs.

#### Multi-namespaced applications
During sync, Argo CD will now honor any explicitly set namespace in a manifest. Manifests without a
namespace will continue deploy to the "preferred" namespace, as specified in app's
`spec.destination.namespace`. This enables support for a class of applications which install to
multiple namespaces. For example, Argo CD can now install the
[prometheus-operator](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator)
helm chart, which deploys some resources into `kube-system`, and others into the
`prometheus-operator` namespace.

#### Large application support
Full resource objects are no longer stored in the Application CRD object status. Instead, only
lightweight metadata is stored in the status, such as a resource's sync and health status.
This change enabled Argo CD to support applications with a very large number of resources 
(e.g. istio), and reduces the bandwidth requirements when listing applications in the UI.

#### Resource lifecycle hook improvements
Resource lifecycle hooks (e.g. PreSync, PostSync) are now visible/manageable from the UI.
Additionally, bare Pods with a restart policy of Never can now be used as a resource hook, as an
alternative to Jobs, Workflows.

#### K8s recommended application labels
The tracking label for resources has been changed to use `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, as
recommended in [Kubernetes recommended labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/),
(changed from `applications.argoproj.io/app-name`). This will enable applications managed by Argo CD
to interoperate with other tooling which are also converging on this labeling, such as the
Kubernetes dashboard. Additionally, Argo CD no longer injects any tracking labels at the
`spec.template.metadata` level.

#### External OIDC provider support
Argo CD now supports auth delegation to an existing, external OIDC providers without the need for
running Dex (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Auth0, Microsoft, etc...)

The optional, [Dex IDP OIDC provider](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) is still bundled as part of the
default installation, in order to provide a seamless out-of-box experience, enabling Argo CD to
integrate with non-OIDC providers, and to benefit from Dex's full range of
[connectors](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/tree/master/Documentation/connectors).

#### OIDC group bindings to Project Roles
OIDC group claims from an OAuth2 provider can now be bound to a Argo CD project roles. Previously,
group claims could only be managed in the centralized ConfigMap, `argocd-rbac-cm`. They can now be
managed at a project level. This enables project admins to self service access to applications
within a project.

#### Declarative Argo CD configuration
Argo CD settings can be now be configured either declaratively, or imperatively. The `argocd-cm`
ConfigMap now has a `repositories` field, which can reference credentials in a normal Kubernetes
secret which you can create declaratively, outside of Argo CD.

#### Helm repository support
Helm repositories can be configured at the system level, enabling the deployment of helm charts
which have a dependency to external helm repositories.

### Breaking changes:

* Argo CD's resource names were renamed for consistency. For example, the application-controller
  deployment was renamed to argocd-application-controller. When upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11,
  the older resources should be pruned to avoid inconsistent state and controller in-fighting.

* As a consequence to moving to recommended kubernetes labels, when upgrading from v0.10 to v0.11,
  all applications will immediately be OutOfSync due to the change in tracking labels. This will
  correct itself with another sync of the application. However, since Pods will be recreated, please
  take this into consideration, especially if your applications are configured with auto-sync.

* There was significant reworking of the `app.status` fields to reduce the payload size, simplify
  the datastructure and remove fields which were no longer used by the controller. No breaking
  changes were made in `app.spec`.

* An older Argo CD CLI (v0.10 and below) will not be compatible with Argo CD v0.11. To keep
  CI pipelines in sync with the API server, it is recommended to have pipelines download the CLI
  directly from the API server https://${ARGOCD_SERVER}/download/argocd-linux-amd64 during the CI
  pipeline.

### Notes about upgrading from v0.8
* Cluster wide resources should be allowed in default project (due to issue #330):

```
argocd project allow-cluster-resource default '*' '*'
```

* Projects now provide the ability to allow or deny deployments of cluster-scoped resources
(e.g. Namespaces, ClusterRoles, CustomResourceDefinitions). When upgrading from v0.8 to v0.9, to
match the behavior of v0.8 (which did not have restrictions on deploying resources) and continue to
allow deployment of cluster-scoped resources, an additional command should be run:

```bash
argocd proj allow-cluster-resource default '*' '*'
```

The above command allows the `default` project to deploy any cluster-scoped resources which matches
the behavior of v0.8.

* The secret keys in the argocd-secret containing the TLS certificate and key, has been renamed from
  `server.crt` and `server.key` to the standard `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys. This enables Argo CD
  to integrate better with Ingress and cert-manager. When upgrading to v0.9, the `server.crt` and
  `server.key` keys in argocd-secret should be renamed to the new keys.

### Changes since v0.8:
+ Auto-sync option in application CRD instance (issue #79)
+ Support raw jsonnet as an application source (issue #540)
+ Reorder K8s resources to correct creation order (issue #102)

+ Support --in-cluster authentication without providing a kubeconfig (issue #527)
+ Special handling of CustomResourceDefinitions (issue #613)

### Notes about upgrading from v0.7
* The RBAC model has been improved to support explicit denies. What this means is that any previous
RBAC policy rules, need to be rewritten to include one extra column with the effect:
`allow` or `deny`. For example, if a rule was written like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*
    ```
    It should be rewritten to look like this:
    ```
    p, my-org:my-team, applications, get, */*, allow
    ```

+ Support kustomize as an application source (issue #510)
