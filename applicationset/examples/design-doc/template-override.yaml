# App templates can also be defined as part of the generator's template stanza. Sometimes it is
# useful to do this in order to override the spec.template stanza, and when simple string
# parameterization are insufficient. In the below examples, the generators[].XXX.template is 
# a partial definition, which overrides/patch the default template.
